---mt10.1-10.15 { (jesus sends the twelve)
1He called his twelve disciples to him and gave them authority to drive out
  evil spirits and to heal every disease and sickness.
2These are the names of the twelve apostles:
  first, Simon (who is called Peter) and his brother Andrew;
  James son of Zebedee, and his brother John;
3Philip and Bartholomew;
  Thomas and Matthew the tax collector;
  James son of Alphaeus, and Thaddaeus;
4Simon the Zealot and Judas Iscariot, who betrayed him.
5These twelve Jesus sent out with the following instructions:
  "Do not go among the Gentiles or enter any town of the Samaritans.
6Go rather to the lost sheep of Israel.
7As you go, preach this message: 'The kingdom of heaven is near.'
8Heal the sick, raise the dead, cleanse those who have leprosy,
  drive out demons. Freely you have received, freely give.
9Do not take along any gold or silver or copper in your belts;
10take no bag for the journey, or extra tunic, or sandals or a staff;
  for the worker is worth his keep.
11"Whatever town or village you enter, search for some worthy person there
  and stay at his house until you leave.
12As you enter the home, give it your greeting.
13If the home is deserving, let your peace rest on it;
  if it is not, let your peace return to you.
14If anyone will not welcome you or listen to your words,
  shake the dust off your feet when you leave that home or town.
15I tell you the truth, it will be more bearable for Sodom and Gomorrah on
  the day of judgment than for that town.
}

---mt10.16-10.42 { (sheep among wolves)
16I am sending you out like sheep among wolves.
  Therefore be as shrewd as snakes and as innocent as doves.
17"Be on your guard against men; they will hand you over to the local councils
  and flog you in their synagogues.
18On my account you will be brought before governors and kings as
  witnesses to them and to the Gentiles.
19But when they arrest you, do not worry about what to say or how to say it.
  At that time you will be given what to say,
20for it will not be you speaking, but the Spirit of your Father
  speaking through you.
21"Brother will betray brother to death, and a father his child;
  children will rebel against their parents and have them put to death.
22All men will hate you because of me,
but he who stands firm to the end will be saved.
23When you are persecuted in one place, flee to another.
  I tell you the truth, you will not finish going through the cities of
  Israel before the Son of Man comes.
24"A student is not above his teacher, nor a servant above his master.
25It is enough for the student to be like his teacher,
  and the servant like his master.
  If the head of the house has been called Beelzebub, how much more
  the members of his household!
26"So do not be afraid of them.
  There is nothing concealed that will not be disclosed,
  or hidden that will not be made known.
27What I tell you in the dark, speak in the daylight;
  what is whispered in your ear, proclaim from the roofs.
28Do not be afraid of those who kill the body but cannot kill the soul.
  Rather, be afraid of the One who can destroy both soul and body in hell.
29Are not two sparrows sold for a penny?
  Yet not one of them will fall to the ground apart from
  the will of your Father.
30And even the very hairs of your head are all numbered.
31So don't be afraid; you are worth more than many sparrows.
32"Whoever acknowledges me before men,
  I will also acknowledge him before my Father in heaven.
33But whoever disowns me before men,
  I will disown him before my Father in heaven.
34"Do not suppose that I have come to bring peace to the earth.
  I did not come to bring peace, but a sword.
35For I have come to turn
  "'a man against his father, a daughter against her mother,
  a daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law--
36a man's enemies will be the members of his own household.'
37"Anyone who loves his father or mother more than me
  is not worthy of me;
  anyone who loves his son or daughter more than me
  is not worthy of me;
38and anyone who does not take his cross and follow me
  is not worthy of me.
39Whoever finds his life will lose it,
  and whoever loses his life for my sake will find it.
40"He who receives you receives me,
  and he who receives me receives the one who sent me.
41Anyone who receives a prophet because he is a prophet
  will receive a prophet's reward,
  and anyone who receives a righteous man because he is a righteous man
  will receive a righteous man's reward.
42And if anyone gives even a cup of cold water to one of these little ones
  because he is my disciple, I tell you the truth,
  he will certainly not lose his reward."

---mt11.1-11.30 { (ch11)
1After Jesus had finished
instructing his twelve disciples, he went
on from there to teach and preach in the
towns of Galilee.
2When John heard in prison what Christ
was doing, he sent his disciples
3to ask him, "Are you the one who was
to come, or should we expect someone
else?"
4Jesus replied, "Go back and report to
John what you hear and see:
5The blind receive sight, the lame walk,
those who have leprosy are cured, the
deaf hear, the dead are raised, and the
good news is preached to the poor.
6Blessed is the man who does not fall
away on account of me."
7As John's disciples were leaving, Jesus
began to speak to the crowd about
John: "What did you go out into the
desert to see? A reed swayed by the
wind?
8If not, what did you go out to see? A
man dressed in fine clothes? No, those
who wear fine clothes are in kings'
palaces.
9Then what did you go out to see? A
prophet? Yes, I tell you, and more than
a prophet.
10This is the one about whom it is
written: " 'I will send my messenger
ahead of you, who will prepare your way
before you.'
11I tell you the truth: Among those born
of women there has not risen anyone
greater than John the Baptist; yet he
who is least in the kingdom of heaven is
greater than he.
12From the days of John the Baptist until
now, the kingdom of heaven has been
forcefully advancing, and forceful men
lay hold of it.
13For all the Prophets and the Law
prophesied until John.
14And if you are willing to accept it, he is
the Elijah who was to come.
15He who has ears, let him hear.
16"To what can I compare this
generation? They are like children sitting
in the marketplaces and calling out to
others:
17" 'We played the flute for you, and you
did not dance; we sang a dirge and you
did not mourn.'
18For John came neither eating nor
drinking, and they say, 'He has a
demon.'
19The Son of Man came eating and
drinking, and they say, 'Here is a glutton
and a drunkard, a friend of tax collectors
and "sinners." ' But wisdom is proved
right by her actions."
20Then Jesus began to denounce the
cities in which most of his miracles had
been performed, because they did not
repent.
21"Woe to you, Korazin! Woe to you,
Bethsaida! If the miracles that were
performed in you had been performed in
Tyre and Sidon, they would have
repented long ago in sackcloth and
ashes.
22But I tell you, it will be more bearable
for Tyre and Sidon on the day of
judgment than for you.
23And you, Capernaum, will you be lifted
up to the skies? No, you will go down to
the depths. If the miracles that were
performed in you had been performed in
Sodom, it would have remained to this
day.
24But I tell you that it will be more
bearable for Sodom on the day of
judgment than for you."
25At that time Jesus said, "I praise you,
Father, Lord of heaven and earth,
because you have hidden these things
from the wise and learned, and revealed
them to little children.
26Yes, Father, for this was your good
pleasure.
27"All things have been committed to me
by my Father. No one knows the Son
except the Father, and no one knows
the Father except the Son and those to
whom the Son chooses to reveal him.
28"Come to me, all you who are weary
and burdened, and I will give you rest.
29Take my yoke upon you and learn
from me, for I am gentle and humble in
heart, and you will find rest for your
souls.
30For my yoke is easy and my burden is
light."

---mt12.1-12.50 { (ch12)
1At that time Jesus went through
the grainfields on the Sabbath. His
disciples were hungry and began to pick
some heads of grain and eat them.
2When the Pharisees saw this, they said
to him, "Look! Your disciples are doing
what is unlawful on the Sabbath."
3He answered, "Haven't you read what
David did when he and his companions
were hungry?
4He entered the house of God, and he
and his companions ate the consecrated
bread--which was not lawful for them to
do, but only for the priests.
5Or haven't you read in the Law that on
the Sabbath the priests in the temple
desecrate the day and yet are innocent?
6I tell you that one greater than the
temple is here.
7If you had known what these words
mean, 'I desire mercy, not sacrifice,' you
would not have condemned the innocent.
8For the Son of Man is Lord of the
Sabbath."
9Going on from that place, he went into
their synagogue,
10and a man with a shriveled hand was
there. Looking for a reason to accuse
Jesus, they asked him, "Is it lawful to
heal on the Sabbath?"
11He said to them, "If any of you has a
sheep and it falls into a pit on the
Sabbath, will you not take hold of it and
lift it out?
12How much more valuable is a man
than a sheep! Therefore it is lawful to do
good on the Sabbath."
13Then he said to the man, "Stretch out
your hand." So he stretched it out and it
was completely restored, just as sound
as the other.
14But the Pharisees went out and plotted
how they might kill Jesus.
15Aware of this, Jesus withdrew from
that place. Many followed him, and he
healed all their sick,
16warning them not to tell who he was.
17This was to fulfill what was spoken
through the prophet Isaiah:
18"Here is my servant whom I have
chosen, the one I love, in whom I
delight; I will put my Spirit on him, and
he will proclaim justice to the nations.
19He will not quarrel or cry out; no one
will hear his voice in the streets.
20A bruised reed he will not break, and a
smoldering wick he will not snuff out, till
he leads justice to victory.
21In his name the nations will put their
hope."
22Then they brought him a demonpossessed
man who was blind and
mute, and Jesus healed him, so that he
could both talk and see.
23All the people were astonished and
said, "Could this be the Son of David?"
24But when the Pharisees heard this,
they said, "It is only by Beelzebub, the
prince of demons, that this fellow drives
out demons."
25Jesus knew their thoughts and said to
them, "Every kingdom divided against
itself will be ruined, and every city or
household divided against itself will not
stand.
26If Satan drives out Satan, he is divided
against himself. How then can his
kingdom stand?
27And if I drive out demons by
Beelzebub, by whom do your people
drive them out? So then, they will be
your judges.
28But if I drive out demons by the Spirit
of God, then the kingdom of God has
come upon you.
29"Or again, how can anyone enter a
strong man's house and carry off his
possessions unless he first ties up the
strong man? Then he can rob his house.
30"He who is not with me is against me,
and he who does not gather with me
scatters.
31And so I tell you, every sin and
blasphemy will be forgiven men, but the
blasphemy against the Spirit will not be
forgiven.
32Anyone who speaks a word against
the Son of Man will be forgiven, but
anyone who speaks against the Holy
Spirit will not be forgiven, either in this
age or in the age to come.
33"Make a tree good and its fruit will be
good, or make a tree bad and its fruit
will be bad, for a tree is recognized by
its fruit.
34You brood of vipers, how can you who
are evil say anything good? For out of
the overflow of the heart the mouth
speaks.
35The good man brings good things out
of the good stored up in him, and the
evil man brings evil things out of the evil
stored up in him.
36But I tell you that men will have to give
account on the day of judgment for
every careless word they have spoken.
37For by your words you will be
acquitted, and by your words you will be
condemned."
38Then some of the Pharisees and
teachers of the law said to him,
"Teacher, we want to see a miraculous
sign from you."
39He answered, "A wicked and
adulterous generation asks for a
miraculous sign! But none will be given
it except the sign of the prophet Jonah.
40For as Jonah was three days and
three nights in the belly of a huge fish,
so the Son of Man will be three days
and three nights in the heart of the earth.
41The men of Nineveh will stand up at
the judgment with this generation and
condemn it; for they repented at the
preaching of Jonah, and now one
greater than Jonah is here.
42The Queen of the South will rise at the
judgment with this generation and
condemn it; for she came from the ends
of the earth to listen to Solomon's
wisdom, and now one greater than
Solomon is here.
43"When an evil spirit comes out of a
man, it goes through arid places seeking
rest and does not find it.
44Then it says, 'I will return to the house
I left.' When it arrives, it finds the house
unoccupied, swept clean and put in
order.
45Then it goes and takes with it seven
other spirits more wicked than itself, and
they go in and live there. And the final
condition of that man is worse than the
first. That is how it will be with this
wicked generation."
46While Jesus was still talking to the
crowd, his mother and brothers stood
outside, wanting to speak to him.
47Someone told him, "Your mother and
brothers are standing outside, wanting
to speak to you."
48He replied to him, "Who is my mother,
and who are my brothers?"
49Pointing to his disciples, he said, "Here
are my mother and my brothers.
50For whoever does the will of my Father
in heaven is my brother and sister and
mother."
}

---mt13.1-13.58 { (ch13)
1That same day Jesus went out of
the house and sat by the lake.
2Such large crowds gathered around
him that he got into a boat and sat in it,
while all the people stood on the shore.
3Then he told them many things in
parables, saying: "A farmer went out to
sow his seed.
4As he was scattering the seed, some
fell along the path, and the birds came
and ate it up.
5Some fell on rocky places, where it did
not have much soil. It sprang up quickly,
because the soil was shallow.
6But when the sun came up, the plants
were scorched, and they withered
because they had no root.
7Other seed fell among thorns, which
grew up and choked the plants.
8Still other seed fell on good soil, where
it produced a crop--a hundred, sixty or
thirty times what was sown.
9He who has ears, let him hear."
10The disciples came to him and asked,
"Why do you speak to the people in
parables?"
11He replied, "The knowledge of the
secrets of the kingdom of heaven has
been given to you, but not to them.
12Whoever has will be given more, and
he will have an abundance. Whoever
does not have, even what he has will be
taken from him.
13This is why I speak to them in
parables: "Though seeing, they do not
see; though hearing, they do not hear or
understand.
14In them is fulfilled the prophecy of
Isaiah: " 'You will be ever hearing but
never understanding; you will be ever
seeing but never perceiving.
15For this people's heart has become
calloused; they hardly hear with their
ears, and they have closed their eyes.
Otherwise they might see with their eyes,
hear with their ears, understand with
their hearts and turn, and I would heal
them.'
16But blessed are your eyes because
they see, and your ears because they
hear.
17For I tell you the truth, many prophets
and righteous men longed to see what
you see but did not see it, and to hear
what you hear but did not hear it.
18"Listen then to what the parable of the
sower means:
19When anyone hears the message
about the kingdom and does not
understand it, the evil one comes and
snatches away what was sown in his
heart. This is the seed sown along the
path.
20The one who received the seed that
fell on rocky places is the man who
hears the word and at once receives it
with joy.
21But since he has no root, he lasts only
a short time. When trouble or
persecution comes because of the word,
he quickly falls away.
22The one who received the seed that
fell among the thorns is the man who
hears the word, but the worries of this
life and the deceitfulness of wealth
choke it, making it unfruitful.
23But the one who received the seed
that fell on good soil is the man who
hears the word and understands it. He
produces a crop, yielding a hundred,
sixty or thirty times what was sown."
24Jesus told them another parable: "The
kingdom of heaven is like a man who
sowed good seed in his field.
25But while everyone was sleeping, his
enemy came and sowed weeds among
the wheat, and went away.
26When the wheat sprouted and formed
heads, then the weeds also appeared.
27"The owner's servants came to him
and said, 'Sir, didn't you sow good seed
in your field? Where then did the weeds
come from?'
28" 'An enemy did this,' he replied. "The
servants asked him, 'Do you want us to
go and pull them up?'
29" 'No,' he answered, 'because while
you are pulling the weeds, you may root
up the wheat with them.
30Let both grow together until the
harvest. At that time I will tell the
harvesters: First collect the weeds and
tie them in bundles to be burned; then
gather the wheat and bring it into my
barn.' "
31He told them another parable: "The
kingdom of heaven is like a mustard
seed, which a man took and planted in
his field.
32Though it is the smallest of all your
seeds, yet when it grows, it is the largest
of garden plants and becomes a tree, so
that the birds of the air come and perch
in its branches."
33He told them still another parable:
"The kingdom of heaven is like yeast
that a woman took and mixed into a
large amount of flour until it worked all
through the dough."
34Jesus spoke all these things to the
crowd in parables; he did not say
anything to them without using a parable.
35So was fulfilled what was spoken
through the prophet: "I will open my
mouth in parables, I will utter things
hidden since the creation of the world."
36Then he left the crowd and went into
the house. His disciples came to him
and said, "Explain to us the parable of
the weeds in the field."
37He answered, "The one who sowed
the good seed is the Son of Man.
38The field is the world, and the good
seed stands for the sons of the kingdom.
The weeds are the sons of the evil one,
39and the enemy who sows them is the
devil. The harvest is the end of the age,
and the harvesters are angels.
40"As the weeds are pulled up and
burned in the fire, so it will be at the end
of the age.
41The Son of Man will send out his
angels, and they will weed out of his
kingdom everything that causes sin and
all who do evil.
42They will throw them into the fiery
furnace, where there will be weeping
and gnashing of teeth.
43Then the righteous will shine like the
sun in the kingdom of their Father. He
who has ears, let him hear.
44"The kingdom of heaven is like
treasure hidden in a field. When a man
found it, he hid it again, and then in his
joy went and sold all he had and bought
that field.
45"Again, the kingdom of heaven is like a
merchant looking for fine pearls.
46When he found one of great value, he
went away and sold everything he had
and bought it.
47"Once again, the kingdom of heaven is
like a net that was let down into the lake
and caught all kinds of fish.
48When it was full, the fishermen pulled
it up on the shore. Then they sat down
and collected the good fish in baskets,
but threw the bad away.
49This is how it will be at the end of the
age. The angels will come and separate
the wicked from the righteous
50and throw them into the fiery furnace,
where there will be weeping and
gnashing of teeth.
51"Have you understood all these
things?" Jesus asked. "Yes," they
replied.
52He said to them, "Therefore every
teacher of the law who has been
instructed about the kingdom of heaven
is like the owner of a house who brings
out of his storeroom new treasures as
well as old."
53When Jesus had finished these
parables, he moved on from there.
54Coming to his hometown, he began
teaching the people in their synagogue,
and they were amazed. "Where did this
man get this wisdom and these
miraculous powers?" they asked.
55"Isn't this the carpenter's son? Isn't his
mother's name Mary, and aren't his
brothers James, Joseph, Simon and
Judas?
56Aren't all his sisters with us? Where
then did this man get all these things?"
57And they took offense at him. But
Jesus said to them, "Only in his
hometown and in his own house is a
prophet without honor."
58And he did not do many miracles there
because of their lack of faith.
}

---mt14.1-14.36 { (ch14)
1At that time Herod the tetrarch
heard the reports about Jesus,
2and he said to his attendants, "This is
John the Baptist; he has risen from the
dead! That is why miraculous powers
are at work in him."
3Now Herod had arrested John and
bound him and put him in prison
because of Herodias, his brother Philip's
wife,
4for John had been saying to him: "It is
not lawful for you to have her."
5Herod wanted to kill John, but he was
afraid of the people, because they
considered him a prophet.
6On Herod's birthday the daughter of
Herodias danced for them and pleased
Herod so much
7that he promised with an oath to give
her whatever she asked.
8Prompted by her mother, she said,
"Give me here on a platter the head of
John the Baptist."
9The king was distressed, but because
of his oaths and his dinner guests, he
ordered that her request be granted
10and had John beheaded in the prison.
11His head was brought in on a platter
and given to the girl, who carried it to
her mother.
12John's disciples came and took his
body and buried it. Then they went and
told Jesus.
13When Jesus heard what had
happened, he withdrew by boat privately
to a solitary place. Hearing of this, the
crowds followed him on foot from the
towns.
14When Jesus landed and saw a large
crowd, he had compassion on them and
healed their sick.
15As evening approached, the disciples
came to him and said, "This is a remote
place, and it's already getting late. Send
the crowds away, so they can go to the
villages and buy themselves some
food."
16Jesus replied, "They do not need to go
away. You give them something to eat."
17"We have here only five loaves of
bread and two fish," they answered.
18"Bring them here to me," he said.
19And he directed the people to sit down
on the grass. Taking the five loaves and
the two fish and looking up to heaven,
he gave thanks and broke the loaves.
Then he gave them to the disciples, and
the disciples gave them to the people.
20They all ate and were satisfied, and
the disciples picked up twelve basketfuls
of broken pieces that were left over.
21The number of those who ate was
about five thousand men, besides
women and children.
22Immediately Jesus made the disciples
get into the boat and go on ahead of him
to the other side, while he dismissed the
crowd.
23After he had dismissed them, he went
up on a mountainside by himself to pray.
When evening came, he was there
alone,
24but the boat was already a
considerable distance from land,
buffeted by the waves because the wind
was against it.
25During the fourth watch of the night
Jesus went out to them, walking on the
lake.
26When the disciples saw him walking
on the lake, they were terrified. "It's a
ghost," they said, and cried out in fear.
27But Jesus immediately said to them:
"Take courage! It is I. Don't be afraid."
28"Lord, if it's you," Peter replied, "tell me
to come to you on the water."
29"Come," he said.
30Then Peter got down out of the boat,
walked on the water and came toward
Jesus. But when he saw the wind, he
was afraid and, beginning to sink, cried
out, "Lord, save me!"
31Immediately Jesus reached out his
hand and caught him. "You of little faith,"
he said, "why did you doubt?"
32And when they climbed into the boat,
the wind died down.
33Then those who were in the boat
worshiped him, saying, "Truly you are
the Son of God."
34When they had crossed over, they
landed at Gennesaret.
35And when the men of that place
recognized Jesus, they sent word to all
the surrounding country. People brought
all their sick to him
36and begged him to let the sick just
touch the edge of his cloak, and all who
touched him were healed.

---mt15.1-15.39 { (ch15)
1Then some Pharisees and
teachers of the law came to Jesus from
Jerusalem and asked,
2"Why do your disciples break the
tradition of the elders? They don't wash
their hands before they eat!"
3Jesus replied, "And why do you break
the command of God for the sake of
your tradition?
4For God said, 'Honor your father and
mother' and 'Anyone who curses his
father or mother must be put to death.'
5But you say that if a man says to his
father or mother, 'Whatever help you
might otherwise have received from me
is a gift devoted to God,'
6he is not to 'honor his father ' with it.
Thus you nullify the word of God for the
sake of your tradition.
7You hypocrites! Isaiah was right when
he prophesied about you:
8" 'These people honor me with their lips,
but their hearts are far from me.
9They worship me in vain; their
teachings are but rules taught by men.' "
10Jesus called the crowd to him and said,
"Listen and understand.
11What goes into a man's mouth does
not make him 'unclean,' but what comes
out of his mouth, that is what makes him
'unclean.' "
12Then the disciples came to him and
asked, "Do you know that the Pharisees
were offended when they heard this?"
13He replied, "Every plant that my
heavenly Father has not planted will be
pulled up by the roots.
14Leave them; they are blind guides. If a
blind man leads a blind man, both will
fall into a pit."
15Peter said, "Explain the parable to us."
16"Are you still so dull?" Jesus asked
them.
17"Don't you see that whatever enters
the mouth goes into the stomach and
then out of the body?
18But the things that come out of the
mouth come from the heart, and these
make a man 'unclean.'
19For out of the heart come evil thoughts,
murder, adultery, sexual immorality,
theft, false testimony, slander.
20These are what make a man 'unclean';
but eating with unwashed hands does
not make him 'unclean.' "
21Leaving that place, Jesus withdrew to
the region of Tyre and Sidon.
22A Canaanite woman from that vicinity
came to him, crying out, "Lord, Son of
David, have mercy on me! My daughter
is suffering terribly from demonpossession."
23Jesus did not answer a word. So his
disciples came to him and urged him,
"Send her away, for she keeps crying
out after us."
24He answered, "I was sent only to the
lost sheep of Israel."
25The woman came and knelt before
him. "Lord, help me!" she said.
26He replied, "It is not right to take the
children's bread and toss it to their
dogs."
27"Yes, Lord," she said, "but even the
dogs eat the crumbs that fall from their
masters' table."
28Then Jesus answered, "Woman, you
have great faith! Your request is
granted." And her daughter was healed
from that very hour.
29Jesus left there and went along the
Sea of Galilee. Then he went up on a
mountainside and sat down.
30Great crowds came to him, bringing
the lame, the blind, the crippled, the
mute and many others, and laid them at
his feet; and he healed them.
31The people were amazed when they
saw the mute speaking, the crippled
made well, the lame walking and the
blind seeing. And they praised the God
of Israel.
32Jesus called his disciples to him and
said, "I have compassion for these
people; they have already been with me
three days and have nothing to eat. I do
not want to send them away hungry, or
they may collapse on the way."
33His disciples answered, "Where could
we get enough bread in this remote
place to feed such a crowd?"
34"How many loaves do you have?"
Jesus asked. "Seven," they replied, "and
a few small fish."
35He told the crowd to sit down on the
ground.
36Then he took the seven loaves and the
fish, and when he had given thanks, he
broke them and gave them to the
disciples, and they in turn to the people.
37They all ate and were satisfied.
Afterward the disciples picked up seven
basketfuls of broken pieces that were
left over.
38The number of those who ate was four
thousand, besides women and children.
39After Jesus had sent the crowd away,
he got into the boat and went to the
vicinity of Magadan.

1The Pharisees and Sadducees
came to Jesus and tested him by asking
him to show them a sign from heaven.
2He replied, "When evening comes, you
say, 'It will be fair weather, for the sky is
red,'
3and in the morning, 'Today it will be
stormy, for the sky is red and overcast.'
You know how to interpret the
appearance of the sky, but you cannot
interpret the signs of the times.
4A wicked and adulterous generation
looks for a miraculous sign, but none will
be given it except the sign of Jonah."
Jesus then left them and went away.
5When they went across the lake, the
disciples forgot to take bread.
6"Be careful," Jesus said to them. "Be on
your guard against the yeast of the
Pharisees and Sadducees."
7They discussed this among themselves
and said, "It is because we didn't bring
any bread."
8Aware of their discussion, Jesus asked,
"You of little faith, why are you talking
among yourselves about having no
bread?
9Do you still not understand? Don't you
remember the five loaves for the five
thousand, and how many basketfuls you
gathered?
10Or the seven loaves for the four
thousand, and how many basketfuls you
gathered?
11How is it you don't understand that I
was not talking to you about bread? But
be on your guard against the yeast of
the Pharisees and Sadducees."
12Then they understood that he was not
telling them to guard against the yeast
used in bread, but against the teaching
of the Pharisees and Sadducees.
13When Jesus came to the region of
Caesarea Philippi, he asked his
disciples, "Who do people say the Son
of Man is?"
14They replied, "Some say John the
Baptist; others say Elijah; and still others,
Jeremiah or one of the prophets."
15"But what about you?" he asked. "Who
do you say I am?"
16Simon Peter answered, "You are the
Christ, the Son of the living God."
17Jesus replied, "Blessed are you,
Simon son of Jonah, for this was not
revealed to you by man, but by my
Father in heaven.
18And I tell you that you are Peter, and
on this rock I will build my church, and
the gates of Hades will not overcome it.
19I will give you the keys of the kingdom
of heaven; whatever you bind on earth
will be bound in heaven, and whatever
you loose on earth will be loosed in
heaven."
20Then he warned his disciples not to tell
anyone that he was the Christ.
21From that time on Jesus began to
explain to his disciples that he must go
to Jerusalem and suffer many things at
the hands of the elders, chief priests
and teachers of the law, and that he
must be killed and on the third day be
raised to life.
22Peter took him aside and began to
rebuke him. "Never, Lord!" he said.
"This shall never happen to you!"
23Jesus turned and said to Peter, "Get
behind me, Satan! You are a stumbling
block to me; you do not have in mind the
things of God, but the things of men."
24Then Jesus said to his disciples, "If
anyone would come after me, he must
deny himself and take up his cross and
follow me.
25For whoever wants to save his life will
lose it, but whoever loses his life for me
will find it.
26What good will it be for a man if he
gains the whole world, yet forfeits his
soul? Or what can a man give in
exchange for his soul?
27For the Son of Man is going to come in
his Father's glory with his angels, and
then he will reward each person
according to what he has done.
28I tell you the truth, some who are
standing here will not taste death before
they see the Son of Man coming in his
kingdom."

1After six days Jesus took with him
Peter, James and John the brother of
James, and led them up a high
mountain by themselves.
2There he was transfigured before them.
His face shone like the sun, and his
clothes became as white as the light.
3Just then there appeared before them
Moses and Elijah, talking with Jesus.
4Peter said to Jesus, "Lord, it is good for
us to be here. If you wish, I will put up
three shelters--one for you, one for
Moses and one for Elijah."
5While he was still speaking, a bright
cloud enveloped them, and a voice from
the cloud said, "This is my Son, whom I
love; with him I am well pleased. Listen
to him!"
6When the disciples heard this, they fell
facedown to the ground, terrified.
7But Jesus came and touched them.
"Get up," he said. "Don't be afraid."
8When they looked up, they saw no one
except Jesus.
9As they were coming down the
mountain, Jesus instructed them, "Don't
tell anyone what you have seen, until
the Son of Man has been raised from
the dead."
10The disciples asked him, "Why then do
the teachers of the law say that Elijah
must come first?"
11Jesus replied, "To be sure, Elijah
comes and will restore all things.
12But I tell you, Elijah has already come,
and they did not recognize him, but
have done to him everything they
wished. In the same way the Son of
Man is going to suffer at their hands."
13Then the disciples understood that he
was talking to them about John the
Baptist.
14When they came to the crowd, a man
approached Jesus and knelt before him.
15"Lord, have mercy on my son," he said.
"He has seizures and is suffering greatly.
He often falls into the fire or into the
water.
16I brought him to your disciples, but
they could not heal him."
17"O unbelieving and perverse
generation," Jesus replied, "how long
shall I stay with you? How long shall I
put up with you? Bring the boy here to
me."
18Jesus rebuked the demon, and it came
out of the boy, and he was healed from
that moment.
19Then the disciples came to Jesus in
private and asked, "Why couldn't we
drive it out?"
20He replied, "Because you have so little
faith. I tell you the truth, if you have faith
as small as a mustard seed, you can
say to this mountain, 'Move from here to
there' and it will move. Nothing will be
impossible for you."
22When they came together in Galilee,
he said to them, "The Son of Man is
going to be betrayed into the hands of
men.
23They will kill him, and on the third day
he will be raised to life." And the
disciples were filled with grief.
24After Jesus and his disciples arrived in
Capernaum, the collectors of the twodrachma
tax came to Peter and asked,
"Doesn't your teacher pay the temple
tax ?"
25"Yes, he does," he replied. When
Peter came into the house, Jesus was
the first to speak. "What do you think,
Simon?" he asked. "From whom do the
kings of the earth collect duty and taxes-
-from their own sons or from others?"
26"From others," Peter answered.
27"Then the sons are exempt," Jesus
said to him. "But so that we may not
offend them, go to the lake and throw
out your line. Take the first fish you
catch; open its mouth and you will find a
four-drachma coin. Take it and give it to
them for my tax and yours."

---mt18.1-18.35 { (ch18)
1At that time the disciples came to
Jesus and asked, "Who is the greatest
in the kingdom of heaven?"
2He called a little child and had him
stand among them.
3And he said: "I tell you the truth, unless
you change and become like little
children, you will never enter the
kingdom of heaven.
4Therefore, whoever humbles himself
like this child is the greatest in the
kingdom of heaven.
5"And whoever welcomes a little child
like this in my name welcomes me.
6But if anyone causes one of these little
ones who believe in me to sin, it would
be better for him to have a large
millstone hung around his neck and to
be drowned in the depths of the sea.
7"Woe to the world because of the
things that cause people to sin! Such
things must come, but woe to the man
through whom they come!
8If your hand or your foot causes you to
sin, cut it off and throw it away. It is
better for you to enter life maimed or
crippled than to have two hands or two
feet and be thrown into eternal fire.
9And if your eye causes you to sin,
gouge it out and throw it away. It is
better for you to enter life with one eye
than to have two eyes and be thrown
into the fire of hell.
10"See that you do not look down on one
of these little ones. For I tell you that
their angels in heaven always see the
face of my Father in heaven.
12"What do you think? If a man owns a
hundred sheep, and one of them
wanders away, will he not leave the
ninety-nine on the hills and go to look for
the one that wandered off?
13And if he finds it, I tell you the truth, he
is happier about that one sheep than
about the ninety-nine that did not
wander off.
14In the same way your Father in
heaven is not willing that any of these
little ones should be lost.
15"If your brother sins against you, go
and show him his fault, just between the
two of you. If he listens to you, you have
won your brother over.
16But if he will not listen, take one or two
others along, so that 'every matter may
be established by the testimony of two
or three witnesses.'
17If he refuses to listen to them, tell it to
the church; and if he refuses to listen
even to the church, treat him as you
would a pagan or a tax collector.
18"I tell you the truth, whatever you bind
on earth will be bound in heaven, and
whatever you loose on earth will be
loosed in heaven.
19"Again, I tell you that if two of you on
earth agree about anything you ask for,
it will be done for you by my Father in
heaven.
20For where two or three come together
in my name, there am I with them."
21Then Peter came to Jesus and asked,
"Lord, how many times shall I forgive my
brother when he sins against me? Up to
seven times?"
22Jesus answered, "I tell you, not seven
times, but seventy-seven times.
23"Therefore, the kingdom of heaven is
like a king who wanted to settle
accounts with his servants.
24As he began the settlement, a man
who owed him ten thousand talents was
brought to him.
25Since he was not able to pay, the
master ordered that he and his wife and
his children and all that he had be sold
to repay the debt.
26"The servant fell on his knees before
him. 'Be patient with me,' he begged,
'and I will pay back everything.'
27The servant's master took pity on him,
canceled the debt and let him go.
28"But when that servant went out, he
found one of his fellow servants who
owed him a hundred denarii. He
grabbed him and began to choke him.
'Pay back what you owe me!' he
demanded.
29"His fellow servant fell to his knees
and begged him, 'Be patient with me,
and I will pay you back.'
30"But he refused. Instead, he went off
and had the man thrown into prison until
he could pay the debt.
31When the other servants saw what
had happened, they were greatly
distressed and went and told their
master everything that had happened.
32"Then the master called the servant in.
'You wicked servant,' he said, 'I
canceled all that debt of yours because
you begged me to.
33Shouldn't you have had mercy on your
fellow servant just as I had on you?'
34In anger his master turned him over to
the jailers to be tortured, until he should
pay back all he owed.
35"This is how my heavenly Father will
treat each of you unless you forgive
your brother from your heart."

---mt19.1-19.20 { (ch19)
1When Jesus had finished saying
these things, he left Galilee and went
into the region of Judea to the other side
of the Jordan.
2Large crowds followed him, and he
healed them there.
3Some Pharisees came to him to test
him. They asked, "Is it lawful for a man
to divorce his wife for any and every
reason?"
4"Haven't you read," he replied, "that at
the beginning the Creator 'made them
male and female,'
5and said, 'For this reason a man will
leave his father and mother and be
united to his wife, and the two will
become one flesh' ?
6So they are no longer two, but one.
Therefore what God has joined together,
let man not separate."
7"Why then," they asked, "did Moses
command that a man give his wife a
certificate of divorce and send her
away?"
8Jesus replied, "Moses permitted you to
divorce your wives because your hearts
were hard. But it was not this way from
the beginning.
9I tell you that anyone who divorces his
wife, except for marital unfaithfulness,
and marries another woman commits
adultery."
10The disciples said to him, "If this is the
situation between a husband and wife, it
is better not to marry."
11Jesus replied, "Not everyone can
accept this word, but only those to
whom it has been given.
12For some are eunuchs because they
were born that way; others were made
that way by men; and others have
renounced marriage because of the
kingdom of heaven. The one who can
accept this should accept it."
13Then little children were brought to
Jesus for him to place his hands on
them and pray for them. But the
disciples rebuked those who brought
them.
14Jesus said, "Let the little children come
to me, and do not hinder them, for the
kingdom of heaven belongs to such as
these."
15When he had placed his hands on
them, he went on from there.
16Now a man came up to Jesus and
asked, "Teacher, what good thing must I
do to get eternal life?"
17"Why do you ask me about what is
good?" Jesus replied. "There is only
One who is good. If you want to enter
life, obey the commandments."
18"Which ones?" the man inquired.
19Jesus replied, " 'Do not murder, do not
commit adultery, do not steal, do not
give false testimony, honor your father
and mother,' and 'love your neighbor as
yourself.' "
20"All these I have kept," the young man
said. "What do I still lack?"
21Jesus answered, "If you want to be
perfect, go, sell your possessions and
give to the poor, and you will have
treasure in heaven. Then come, follow
me."
22When the young man heard this, he
went away sad, because he had great
wealth.
23Then Jesus said to his disciples, "I tell
you the truth, it is hard for a rich man to
enter the kingdom of heaven.
24Again I tell you, it is easier for a camel
to go through the eye of a needle than
for a rich man to enter the kingdom of
God."
25When the disciples heard this, they
were greatly astonished and asked,
"Who then can be saved?"
26Jesus looked at them and said, "With
man this is impossible, but with God all
things are possible."
27Peter answered him, "We have left
everything to follow you! What then will
there be for us?"
28Jesus said to them, "I tell you the truth,
at the renewal of all things, when the
Son of Man sits on his glorious throne,
you who have followed me will also sit
on twelve thrones, judging the twelve
tribes of Israel.
29And everyone who has left houses or
brothers or sisters or father or mother or
children or fields for my sake will receive
a hundred times as much and will inherit
eternal life.
30But many who are first will be last, and
many who are last will be first.

1"For the kingdom of heaven is like
a landowner who went out early in the
morning to hire men to work in his
vineyard.
2He agreed to pay them a denarius for
the day and sent them into his vineyard.
3"About the third hour he went out and
saw others standing in the marketplace
doing nothing.
4He told them, 'You also go and work in
my vineyard, and I will pay you whatever
is right.'
5So they went.
6"He went out again about the sixth hour
and the ninth hour and did the same
thing. About the eleventh hour he went
out and found still others standing
around. He asked them, 'Why have you
been standing here all day long doing
nothing?'
7" 'Because no one has hired us,' they
answered. "He said to them, 'You also
go and work in my vineyard.'
8"When evening came, the owner of the
vineyard said to his foreman, 'Call the
workers and pay them their wages,
beginning with the last ones hired and
going on to the first.'
9"The workers who were hired about the
eleventh hour came and each received
a denarius.
10So when those came who were hired
first, they expected to receive more. But
each one of them also received a
denarius.
11When they received it, they began to
grumble against the landowner.
12'These men who were hired last
worked only one hour,' they said, 'and
you have made them equal to us who
have borne the burden of the work and
the heat of the day.'
13"But he answered one of them, 'Friend,
I am not being unfair to you. Didn't you
agree to work for a denarius?
14Take your pay and go. I want to give
the man who was hired last the same as
I gave you.
15Don't I have the right to do what I want
with my own money? Or are you
envious because I am generous?'
16"So the last will be first, and the first
will be last."
17Now as Jesus was going up to
Jerusalem, he took the twelve disciples
aside and said to them,
18"We are going up to Jerusalem, and
the Son of Man will be betrayed to the
chief priests and the teachers of the law.
They will condemn him to death
19and will turn him over to the Gentiles
to be mocked and flogged and crucified.
On the third day he will be raised to life!"
20Then the mother of Zebedee's sons
came to Jesus with her sons and,
kneeling down, asked a favor of him.
21"What is it you want?" he asked. She
said, "Grant that one of these two sons
of mine may sit at your right and the
other at your left in your kingdom."
22"You don't know what you are asking,"
Jesus said to them. "Can you drink the
cup I am going to drink?" "We can," they
answered.
23Jesus said to them, "You will indeed
drink from my cup, but to sit at my right
or left is not for me to grant. These
places belong to those for whom they
have been prepared by my Father."
24When the ten heard about this, they
were indignant with the two brothers.
25Jesus called them together and said,
"You know that the rulers of the Gentiles
lord it over them, and their high officials
exercise authority over them.
26Not so with you. Instead, whoever
wants to become great among you must
be your servant,
27and whoever wants to be first must be
your slave--
28just as the Son of Man did not come to
be served, but to serve, and to give his
life as a ransom for many."
29As Jesus and his disciples were
leaving Jericho, a large crowd followed
him.
30Two blind men were sitting by the
roadside, and when they heard that
Jesus was going by, they shouted, "Lord,
Son of David, have mercy on us!"
31The crowd rebuked them and told
them to be quiet, but they shouted all
the louder, "Lord, Son of David, have
mercy on us!"
32Jesus stopped and called them. "What
do you want me to do for you?" he
asked.
33"Lord," they answered, "we want our
sight."
34Jesus had compassion on them and
touched their eyes. Immediately they
received their sight and followed him.
}

---mt21.1-21.46 { (ch21)
1As they approached Jerusalem
and came to Bethphage on the Mount of
Olives, Jesus sent two disciples,
2saying to them, "Go to the village
ahead of you, and at once you will find a
donkey tied there, with her colt by her.
Untie them and bring them to me.
3If anyone says anything to you, tell him
that the Lord needs them, and he will
send them right away."
4This took place to fulfill what was
spoken through the prophet:
5"Say to the Daughter of Zion, 'See, your
king comes to you, gentle and riding on
a donkey, on a colt, the foal of a
donkey.' "
6The disciples went and did as Jesus
had instructed them.
7They brought the donkey and the colt,
placed their cloaks on them, and Jesus
sat on them.
8A very large crowd spread their cloaks
on the road, while others cut branches
from the trees and spread them on the
road.
9The crowds that went ahead of him and
those that followed shouted, "Hosanna
to the Son of David!" "Blessed is he who
comes in the name of the Lord!"
"Hosanna in the highest!"
10When Jesus entered Jerusalem, the
whole city was stirred and asked, "Who
is this?"
11The crowds answered, "This is Jesus,
the prophet from Nazareth in Galilee."
12Jesus entered the temple area and
drove out all who were buying and
selling there. He overturned the tables
of the money changers and the benches
of those selling doves.
13"It is written," he said to them, " 'My
house will be called a house of prayer,'
but you are making it a 'den of robbers.'
"
14The blind and the lame came to him at
the temple, and he healed them.
15But when the chief priests and the
teachers of the law saw the wonderful
things he did and the children shouting
in the temple area, "Hosanna to the Son
of David," they were indignant.
16"Do you hear what these children are
saying?" they asked him. "Yes," replied
Jesus, "have you never read, " 'From
the lips of children and infants you have
ordained praise' ?"
17And he left them and went out of the
city to Bethany, where he spent the
night.
18Early in the morning, as he was on his
way back to the city, he was hungry.
19Seeing a fig tree by the road, he went
up to it but found nothing on it except
leaves. Then he said to it, "May you
never bear fruit again!" Immediately the
tree withered.
20When the disciples saw this, they were
amazed. "How did the fig tree wither so
quickly?" they asked.
21Jesus replied, "I tell you the truth, if
you have faith and do not doubt, not
only can you do what was done to the
fig tree, but also you can say to this
mountain, 'Go, throw yourself into the
sea,' and it will be done.
22If you believe, you will receive
whatever you ask for in prayer."
23Jesus entered the temple courts, and,
while he was teaching, the chief priests
and the elders of the people came to
him. "By what authority are you doing
these things?" they asked. "And who
gave you this authority?"
24Jesus replied, "I will also ask you one
question. If you answer me, I will tell you
by what authority I am doing these
things.
25John's baptism--where did it come
from? Was it from heaven, or from
men?"
26They discussed it among themselves
and said, "If we say, 'From heaven,' he
will ask, 'Then why didn't you believe
him?' But if we say, 'From men'--we are
afraid of the people, for they all hold that
John was a prophet."
27So they answered Jesus, "We don't
know." Then he said, "Neither will I tell
you by what authority I am doing these
things.
28"What do you think? There was a man
who had two sons. He went to the first
and said, 'Son, go and work today in the
vineyard.'
29" 'I will not,' he answered, but later he
changed his mind and went.
30"Then the father went to the other son
and said the same thing. He answered,
'I will, sir,' but he did not go.
31"Which of the two did what his father
wanted?" "The first," they answered.
32Jesus said to them, "I tell you the truth,
the tax collectors and the prostitutes are
entering the kingdom of God ahead of
you. For John came to you to show you
the way of righteousness, and you did
not believe him, but the tax collectors
and the prostitutes did. And even after
you saw this, you did not repent and
believe him.
33"Listen to another parable: There was
a landowner who planted a vineyard. He
put a wall around it, dug a winepress in
it and built a watchtower. Then he
rented the vineyard to some farmers
and went away on a journey.
34When the harvest time approached, he
sent his servants to the tenants to
collect his fruit.
35"The tenants seized his servants; they
beat one, killed another, and stoned a
third.
36Then he sent other servants to them,
more than the first time, and the tenants
treated them the same way.
37Last of all, he sent his son to them.
'They will respect my son,' he said.
38"But when the tenants saw the son,
they said to each other, 'This is the heir.
Come, let's kill him and take his
inheritance.'
39So they took him and threw him out of
the vineyard and killed him.
40"Therefore, when the owner of the
vineyard comes, what will he do to those
tenants?"
41"He will bring those wretches to a
wretched end," they replied, "and he will
rent the vineyard to other tenants, who
will give him his share of the crop at
harvest time."
42Jesus said to them, "Have you never
read in the Scriptures: " 'The stone the
builders rejected has become the
capstone ; the Lord has done this, and it
is marvelous in our eyes' ?
43"Therefore I tell you that the kingdom
of God will be taken away from you and
given to a people who will produce its
fruit.
44He who falls on this stone will be
broken to pieces, but he on whom it falls
will be crushed."
45When the chief priests and the
Pharisees heard Jesus' parables, they
knew he was talking about them.
46They looked for a way to arrest him,
but they were afraid of the crowd
because the people held that he was a
prophet.

son.
3He sent his servants to those who had
been invited to the banquet to tell them
to come, but they refused to come.
4"Then he sent some more servants and
said, 'Tell those who have been invited
that I have prepared my dinner: My oxen
and fattened cattle have been butchered,
and everything is ready. Come to the
wedding banquet.'
5"But they paid no attention and went
off--one to his field, another to his
business.
6The rest seized his servants,
mistreated them and killed them.
7The king was enraged. He sent his
army and destroyed those murderers
and burned their city.
8"Then he said to his servants, 'The
wedding banquet is ready, but those I
invited did not deserve to come.
9Go to the street corners and invite to
the banquet anyone you find.'
10So the servants went out into the
streets and gathered all the people they
could find, both good and bad, and the
wedding hall was filled with guests.
11"But when the king came in to see the
guests, he noticed a man there who was
not wearing wedding clothes.
12'Friend,' he asked, 'how did you get in
here without wedding clothes?' The man
was speechless.
13"Then the king told the attendants, 'Tie
him hand and foot, and throw him
outside, into the darkness, where there
will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.'
14"For many are invited, but few are
chosen."
15Then the Pharisees went out and laid
plans to trap him in his words.
16They sent their disciples to him along
with the Herodians. "Teacher," they said,
"we know you are a man of integrity and
that you teach the way of God in
accordance with the truth. You aren't
swayed by men, because you pay no
attention to who they are.
17Tell us then, what is your opinion? Is it
right to pay taxes to Caesar or not?"
18But Jesus, knowing their evil intent,
said, "You hypocrites, why are you
trying to trap me?
19Show me the coin used for paying the
tax." They brought him a denarius,
20and he asked them, "Whose portrait is
this? And whose inscription?"
21"Caesar's," they replied. Then he said
to them, "Give to Caesar what is
Caesar's, and to God what is God's."
22When they heard this, they were
amazed. So they left him and went away.
23That same day the Sadducees, who
say there is no resurrection, came to
him with a question.
24"Teacher," they said, "Moses told us
that if a man dies without having
children, his brother must marry the
widow and have children for him.
25Now there were seven brothers among
us. The first one married and died, and
since he had no children, he left his wife
to his brother.
26The same thing happened to the
second and third brother, right on down
to the seventh.
27Finally, the woman died.
28Now then, at the resurrection, whose
wife will she be of the seven, since all of
them were married to her?"
29Jesus replied, "You are in error
because you do not know the Scriptures
or the power of God.
30At the resurrection people will neither
marry nor be given in marriage; they will
be like the angels in heaven.
31But about the resurrection of the dead-
-have you not read what God said to
you,
32'I am the God of Abraham, the God of
Isaac, and the God of Jacob' ? He is not
the God of the dead but of the living."
33When the crowds heard this, they
were astonished at his teaching.
34Hearing that Jesus had silenced the
Sadducees, the Pharisees got together.
35One of them, an expert in the law,
tested him with this question:
36"Teacher, which is the greatest
commandment in the Law?"
37Jesus replied: " 'Love the Lord your
God with all your heart and with all your
soul and with all your mind.'
38This is the first and greatest
commandment.
39And the second is like it: 'Love your
neighbor as yourself.'
40All the Law and the Prophets hang on
these two commandments."
41While the Pharisees were gathered
together, Jesus asked them,
42"What do you think about the Christ ?
Whose son is he?" "The son of David,"
they replied.
43He said to them, "How is it then that
David, speaking by the Spirit, calls him
'Lord'? For he says,
44" 'The Lord said to my Lord: "Sit at my
right hand until I put your enemies under
your feet." '
45If then David calls him 'Lord,' how can
he be his son?"
46No one could say a word in reply, and
from that day on no one dared to ask
him any more questions.

---mt23.1-23.39 { (ch23)
1Then Jesus said to the crowds
and to his disciples:
2"The teachers of the law and the
Pharisees sit in Moses' seat.
3So you must obey them and do
everything they tell you. But do not do
what they do, for they do not practice
what they preach.
4They tie up heavy loads and put them
on men's shoulders, but they
themselves are not willing to lift a finger
to move them.
5"Everything they do is done for men to
see: They make their phylacteries wide
and the tassels on their garments long;
6they love the place of honor at
banquets and the most important seats
in the synagogues;
7they love to be greeted in the
marketplaces and to have men call them
'Rabbi.'
8"But you are not to be called 'Rabbi,' for
you have only one Master and you are
all brothers.
9And do not call anyone on earth 'father,'
for you have one Father, and he is in
heaven.
10Nor are you to be called 'teacher,' for
you have one Teacher, the Christ.
11The greatest among you will be your
servant.
12For whoever exalts himself will be
humbled, and whoever humbles himself
will be exalted.
13"Woe to you, teachers of the law and
Pharisees, you hypocrites! You shut the
kingdom of heaven in men's faces. You
yourselves do not enter, nor will you let
those enter who are trying to.
15"Woe to you, teachers of the law and
Pharisees, you hypocrites! You travel
over land and sea to win a single
convert, and when he becomes one,
you make him twice as much a son of
hell as you are.
16"Woe to you, blind guides! You say, 'If
anyone swears by the temple, it means
nothing; but if anyone swears by the
gold of the temple, he is bound by his
oath.'
17You blind fools! Which is greater: the
gold, or the temple that makes the gold
sacred?
18You also say, 'If anyone swears by the
altar, it means nothing; but if anyone
swears by the gift on it, he is bound by
his oath.'
19You blind men! Which is greater: the
gift, or the altar that makes the gift
sacred?
20Therefore, he who swears by the altar
swears by it and by everything on it.
21And he who swears by the temple
swears by it and by the one who dwells
in it.
22And he who swears by heaven swears
by God's throne and by the one who sits
on it.
23"Woe to you, teachers of the law and
Pharisees, you hypocrites! You give a
tenth of your spices--mint, dill and
cummin. But you have neglected the
more important matters of the law--
justice, mercy and faithfulness. You
should have practiced the latter, without
neglecting the former.
24You blind guides! You strain out a gnat
but swallow a camel.
25"Woe to you, teachers of the law and
Pharisees, you hypocrites! You clean
the outside of the cup and dish, but
inside they are full of greed and selfindulgence.
26Blind Pharisee! First clean the inside
of the cup and dish, and then the
outside also will be clean.
27"Woe to you, teachers of the law and
Pharisees, you hypocrites! You are like
whitewashed tombs, which look
beautiful on the outside but on the inside
are full of dead men's bones and
everything unclean.
28In the same way, on the outside you
appear to people as righteous but on the
inside you are full of hypocrisy and
wickedness.
29"Woe to you, teachers of the law and
Pharisees, you hypocrites! You build
tombs for the prophets and decorate the
graves of the righteous.
30And you say, 'If we had lived in the
days of our forefathers, we would not
have taken part with them in shedding
the blood of the prophets.'
31So you testify against yourselves that
you are the descendants of those who
murdered the prophets.
32Fill up, then, the measure of the sin of
your forefathers!
33"You snakes! You brood of vipers!
How will you escape being condemned
to hell?
34Therefore I am sending you prophets
and wise men and teachers. Some of
them you will kill and crucify; others you
will flog in your synagogues and pursue
from town to town.
35And so upon you will come all the
righteous blood that has been shed on
earth, from the blood of righteous Abel
to the blood of Zechariah son of
Berekiah, whom you murdered between
the temple and the altar.
36I tell you the truth, all this will come
upon this generation.
37"O Jerusalem, Jerusalem, you who kill
the prophets and stone those sent to
you, how often I have longed to gather
your children together, as a hen gathers
her chicks under her wings, but you
were not willing.
38Look, your house is left to you
desolate.
39For I tell you, you will not see me
again until you say, 'Blessed is he who
comes in the name of the Lord.' "

---mt24.1-24.51 { (ch24)
1Jesus left the temple and was
walking away when his disciples came
up to him to call his attention to its
buildings.
2"Do you see all these things?" he asked.
"I tell you the truth, not one stone here
will be left on another; every one will be
thrown down."
3As Jesus was sitting on the Mount of
Olives, the disciples came to him
privately. "Tell us," they said, "when will
this happen, and what will be the sign of
your coming and of the end of the age?"
4Jesus answered: "Watch out that no
one deceives you.
5For many will come in my name,
claiming, 'I am the Christ, ' and will
deceive many.
6You will hear of wars and rumors of
wars, but see to it that you are not
alarmed. Such things must happen, but
the end is still to come.
7Nation will rise against nation, and
kingdom against kingdom. There will be
famines and earthquakes in various
places.
8All these are the beginning of birth
pains.
9"Then you will be handed over to be
persecuted and put to death, and you
will be hated by all nations because of
me.
10At that time many will turn away from
the faith and will betray and hate each
other,
11and many false prophets will appear
and deceive many people.
12Because of the increase of
wickedness, the love of most will grow
cold,
13but he who stands firm to the end will
be saved.
14And this gospel of the kingdom will be
preached in the whole world as a
testimony to all nations, and then the
end will come.
15"So when you see standing in the holy
place 'the abomination that causes
desolation,' spoken of through the
prophet Daniel--let the reader
understand--
16then let those who are in Judea flee to
the mountains.
17Let no one on the roof of his house go
down to take anything out of the house.
18Let no one in the field go back to get
his cloak.
19How dreadful it will be in those days
for pregnant women and nursing
mothers!
20Pray that your flight will not take place
in winter or on the Sabbath.
21For then there will be great distress,
unequaled from the beginning of the
world until now--and never to be
equaled again.
22If those days had not been cut short,
no one would survive, but for the sake of
the elect those days will be shortened.
23At that time if anyone says to you,
'Look, here is the Christ!' or, 'There he
is!' do not believe it.
24For false Christs and false prophets
will appear and perform great signs and
miracles to deceive even the elect--if
that were possible.
25See, I have told you ahead of time.
26"So if anyone tells you, 'There he is,
out in the desert,' do not go out; or,
'Here he is, in the inner rooms,' do not
believe it.
27For as lightning that comes from the
east is visible even in the west, so will
be the coming of the Son of Man.
28Wherever there is a carcass, there the
vultures will gather.
29"Immediately after the distress of those
days " 'the sun will be darkened, and the
moon will not give its light; the stars will
fall from the sky, and the heavenly
bodies will be shaken.'
30"At that time the sign of the Son of
Man will appear in the sky, and all the
nations of the earth will mourn. They will
see the Son of Man coming on the
clouds of the sky, with power and great
glory.
31And he will send his angels with a loud
trumpet call, and they will gather his
elect from the four winds, from one end
of the heavens to the other.
32"Now learn this lesson from the fig
tree: As soon as its twigs get tender and
its leaves come out, you know that
summer is near.
33Even so, when you see all these
things, you know that it is near, right at
the door.
34I tell you the truth, this generation will
certainly not pass away until all these
things have happened.
35Heaven and earth will pass away, but
my words will never pass away.
36"No one knows about that day or hour,
not even the angels in heaven, nor the
Son, but only the Father.
37As it was in the days of Noah, so it will
be at the coming of the Son of Man.
38For in the days before the flood,
people were eating and drinking,
marrying and giving in marriage, up to
the day Noah entered the ark;
39and they knew nothing about what
would happen until the flood came and
took them all away. That is how it will be
at the coming of the Son of Man.
40Two men will be in the field; one will
be taken and the other left.
41Two women will be grinding with a
hand mill; one will be taken and the
other left.
42"Therefore keep watch, because you
do not know on what day your Lord will
come.
43But understand this: If the owner of the
house had known at what time of night
the thief was coming, he would have
kept watch and would not have let his
house be broken into.
44So you also must be ready, because
the Son of Man will come at an hour
when you do not expect him.
45"Who then is the faithful and wise
servant, whom the master has put in
charge of the servants in his household
to give them their food at the proper
time?
46It will be good for that servant whose
master finds him doing so when he
returns.
47I tell you the truth, he will put him in
charge of all his possessions.
48But suppose that servant is wicked
and says to himself, 'My master is
staying away a long time,'
49and he then begins to beat his fellow
servants and to eat and drink with
drunkards.
50The master of that servant will come
on a day when he does not expect him
and at an hour he is not aware of.
51He will cut him to pieces and assign
him a place with the hypocrites, where
there will be weeping and gnashing of
teeth.

1"At that time the kingdom of
heaven will be like ten virgins who took
their lamps and went out to meet the
bridegroom.
2Five of them were foolish and five were
wise.
3The foolish ones took their lamps but
did not take any oil with them.
4The wise, however, took oil in jars
along with their lamps.
5The bridegroom was a long time in
coming, and they all became drowsy
and fell asleep.
6"At midnight the cry rang out: 'Here's
the bridegroom! Come out to meet him!'
7"Then all the virgins woke up and
trimmed their lamps.
8The foolish ones said to the wise, 'Give
us some of your oil; our lamps are going
out.'
9" 'No,' they replied, 'there may not be
enough for both us and you. Instead, go
to those who sell oil and buy some for
yourselves.'
10"But while they were on their way to
buy the oil, the bridegroom arrived. The
virgins who were ready went in with him
to the wedding banquet. And the door
was shut.
11"Later the others also came. 'Sir! Sir!'
they said. 'Open the door for us!'
12"But he replied, 'I tell you the truth, I
don't know you.'
13"Therefore keep watch, because you
do not know the day or the hour.
14"Again, it will be like a man going on a
journey, who called his servants and
entrusted his property to them.
15To one he gave five talents of money,
to another two talents, and to another
one talent, each according to his ability.
Then he went on his journey.
16The man who had received the five
talents went at once and put his money
to work and gained five more.
17So also, the one with the two talents
gained two more.
18But the man who had received the one
talent went off, dug a hole in the ground
and hid his master's money.
19"After a long time the master of those
servants returned and settled accounts
with them.
20The man who had received the five
talents brought the other five. 'Master,'
he said, 'you entrusted me with five
talents. See, I have gained five more.'
21"His master replied, 'Well done, good
and faithful servant! You have been
faithful with a few things; I will put you in
charge of many things. Come and share
your master's happiness!'
22"The man with the two talents also
came. 'Master,' he said, 'you entrusted
me with two talents; see, I have gained
two more.'
23"His master replied, 'Well done, good
and faithful servant! You have been
faithful with a few things; I will put you in
charge of many things. Come and share
your master's happiness!'
24"Then the man who had received the
one talent came. 'Master,' he said, 'I
knew that you are a hard man,
harvesting where you have not sown
and gathering where you have not
scattered seed.
25So I was afraid and went out and hid
your talent in the ground. See, here is
what belongs to you.'
26"His master replied, 'You wicked, lazy
servant! So you knew that I harvest
where I have not sown and gather
where I have not scattered seed?
27Well then, you should have put my
money on deposit with the bankers, so
that when I returned I would have
received it back with interest.
28" 'Take the talent from him and give it
to the one who has the ten talents.
29For everyone who has will be given
more, and he will have an abundance.
Whoever does not have, even what he
has will be taken from him.
30And throw that worthless servant
outside, into the darkness, where there
will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.'
31"When the Son of Man comes in his
glory, and all the angels with him, he will
sit on his throne in heavenly glory.
32All the nations will be gathered before
him, and he will separate the people one
from another as a shepherd separates
the sheep from the goats.
33He will put the sheep on his right and
the goats on his left.
34"Then the King will say to those on his
right, 'Come, you who are blessed by
my Father; take your inheritance, the
kingdom prepared for you since the
creation of the world.
35For I was hungry and you gave me
something to eat, I was thirsty and you
gave me something to drink, I was a
stranger and you invited me in,
36I needed clothes and you clothed me, I
was sick and you looked after me, I was
in prison and you came to visit me.'
37"Then the righteous will answer him,
'Lord, when did we see you hungry and
feed you, or thirsty and give you
something to drink?
38When did we see you a stranger and
invite you in, or needing clothes and
clothe you?
39When did we see you sick or in prison
and go to visit you?'
40"The King will reply, 'I tell you the truth,
whatever you did for one of the least of
these brothers of mine, you did for me.'
41"Then he will say to those on his left,
'Depart from me, you who are cursed,
into the eternal fire prepared for the
devil and his angels.
42For I was hungry and you gave me
nothing to eat, I was thirsty and you
gave me nothing to drink,
43I was a stranger and you did not invite
me in, I needed clothes and you did not
clothe me, I was sick and in prison and
you did not look after me.'
44"They also will answer, 'Lord, when did
we see you hungry or thirsty or a
stranger or needing clothes or sick or in
prison, and did not help you?'
45"He will reply, 'I tell you the truth,
whatever you did not do for one of the
least of these, you did not do for me.'
46"Then they will go away to eternal
punishment, but the righteous to eternal
life."

1When Jesus had finished saying
all these things, he said to his disciples,
2"As you know, the Passover is two
days away--and the Son of Man will be
handed over to be crucified."
3Then the chief priests and the elders of
the people assembled in the palace of
the high priest, whose name was
Caiaphas,
4and they plotted to arrest Jesus in
some sly way and kill him.
5"But not during the Feast," they said,
"or there may be a riot among the
people."
6While Jesus was in Bethany in the
home of a man known as Simon the
Leper,
7a woman came to him with an alabaster
jar of very expensive perfume, which
she poured on his head as he was
reclining at the table.
8When the disciples saw this, they were
indignant. "Why this waste?" they asked.
9"This perfume could have been sold at
a high price and the money given to the
poor."
10Aware of this, Jesus said to them,
"Why are you bothering this woman?
She has done a beautiful thing to me.
11The poor you will always have with
you, but you will not always have me.
12When she poured this perfume on my
body, she did it to prepare me for burial.
13I tell you the truth, wherever this
gospel is preached throughout the world,
what she has done will also be told, in
memory of her."
14Then one of the Twelve--the one
called Judas Iscariot--went to the chief
priests
15and asked, "What are you willing to
give me if I hand him over to you?" So
they counted out for him thirty silver
coins.
16From then on Judas watched for an
opportunity to hand him over.
17On the first day of the Feast of
Unleavened Bread, the disciples came
to Jesus and asked, "Where do you
want us to make preparations for you to
eat the Passover?"
18He replied, "Go into the city to a
certain man and tell him, 'The Teacher
says: My appointed time is near. I am
going to celebrate the Passover with my
disciples at your house.' "
19So the disciples did as Jesus had
directed them and prepared the
Passover.
20When evening came, Jesus was
reclining at the table with the Twelve.
21And while they were eating, he said, "I
tell you the truth, one of you will betray
me."
22They were very sad and began to say
to him one after the other, "Surely not I,
Lord?"
23Jesus replied, "The one who has
dipped his hand into the bowl with me
will betray me.
24The Son of Man will go just as it is
written about him. But woe to that man
who betrays the Son of Man! It would be
better for him if he had not been born."
25Then Judas, the one who would betray
him, said, "Surely not I, Rabbi?" Jesus
answered, "Yes, it is you."
26While they were eating, Jesus took
bread, gave thanks and broke it, and
gave it to his disciples, saying, "Take
and eat; this is my body."
27Then he took the cup, gave thanks
and offered it to them, saying, "Drink
from it, all of you.
28This is my blood of the covenant,
which is poured out for many for the
forgiveness of sins.
29I tell you, I will not drink of this fruit of
the vine from now on until that day when
I drink it anew with you in my Father's
kingdom."
30When they had sung a hymn, they
went out to the Mount of Olives.
31Then Jesus told them, "This very night
you will all fall away on account of me,
for it is written: " 'I will strike the
shepherd, and the sheep of the flock will
be scattered.'
32But after I have risen, I will go ahead
of you into Galilee."
33Peter replied, "Even if all fall away on
account of you, I never will."
34"I tell you the truth," Jesus answered,
"this very night, before the rooster crows,
you will disown me three times."
35But Peter declared, "Even if I have to
die with you, I will never disown you."
And all the other disciples said the same.
36Then Jesus went with his disciples to a
place called Gethsemane, and he said
to them, "Sit here while I go over there
and pray."
37He took Peter and the two sons of
Zebedee along with him, and he began
to be sorrowful and troubled.
38Then he said to them, "My soul is
overwhelmed with sorrow to the point of
death. Stay here and keep watch with
me."
39Going a little farther, he fell with his
face to the ground and prayed, "My
Father, if it is possible, may this cup be
taken from me. Yet not as I will, but as
you will."
40Then he returned to his disciples and
found them sleeping. "Could you men
not keep watch with me for one hour?"
he asked Peter.
41"Watch and pray so that you will not
fall into temptation. The spirit is willing,
but the body is weak."
42He went away a second time and
prayed, "My Father, if it is not possible
for this cup to be taken away unless I
drink it, may your will be done."
43When he came back, he again found
them sleeping, because their eyes were
heavy.
44So he left them and went away once
more and prayed the third time, saying
the same thing.
45Then he returned to the disciples and
said to them, "Are you still sleeping and
resting? Look, the hour is near, and the
Son of Man is betrayed into the hands of
sinners.
46Rise, let us go! Here comes my
betrayer!"
47While he was still speaking, Judas,
one of the Twelve, arrived. With him
was a large crowd armed with swords
and clubs, sent from the chief priests
and the elders of the people.
48Now the betrayer had arranged a
signal with them: "The one I kiss is the
man; arrest him."
49Going at once to Jesus, Judas said,
"Greetings, Rabbi!" and kissed him.
50Jesus replied, "Friend, do what you
came for."
51Then the men stepped forward, seized
Jesus and arrested him. With that, one
of Jesus' companions reached for his
sword, drew it out and struck the servant
of the high priest, cutting off his ear.
52"Put your sword back in its place,"
Jesus said to him, "for all who draw the
sword will die by the sword.
53Do you think I cannot call on my
Father, and he will at once put at my
disposal more than twelve legions of
angels?
54But how then would the Scriptures be
fulfilled that say it must happen in this
way?"
55At that time Jesus said to the crowd,
"Am I leading a rebellion, that you have
come out with swords and clubs to
capture me? Every day I sat in the
temple courts teaching, and you did not
arrest me.
56But this has all taken place that the
writings of the prophets might be
fulfilled." Then all the disciples deserted
him and fled.
57Those who had arrested Jesus took
him to Caiaphas, the high priest, where
the teachers of the law and the elders
had assembled.
58But Peter followed him at a distance,
right up to the courtyard of the high
priest. He entered and sat down with the
guards to see the outcome.
59The chief priests and the whole
Sanhedrin were looking for false
evidence against Jesus so that they
could put him to death.
60But they did not find any, though many
false witnesses came forward.
61Finally two came forward and declared,
"This fellow said, 'I am able to destroy
the temple of God and rebuild it in three
days.' "
62Then the high priest stood up and said
to Jesus, "Are you not going to answer?
What is this testimony that these men
are bringing against you?"
63But Jesus remained silent. The high
priest said to him, "I charge you under
oath by the living God: Tell us if you are
the Christ, the Son of God."
64"Yes, it is as you say," Jesus replied.
"But I say to all of you: In the future you
will see the Son of Man sitting at the
right hand of the Mighty One and
coming on the clouds of heaven."
65Then the high priest tore his clothes
and said, "He has spoken blasphemy!
Why do we need any more witnesses?
Look, now you have heard the
blasphemy.
66What do you think?" "He is worthy of
death," they answered.
67Then they spit in his face and struck
him with their fists. Others slapped him
68and said, "Prophesy to us, Christ. Who
hit you?"
69Now Peter was sitting out in the
courtyard, and a servant girl came to
him. "You also were with Jesus of
Galilee," she said.
70But he denied it before them all. "I
don't know what you're talking about,"
he said.
71Then he went out to the gateway,
where another girl saw him and said to
the people there, "This fellow was with
Jesus of Nazareth."
72He denied it again, with an oath: "I
don't know the man!"
73After a little while, those standing there
went up to Peter and said, "Surely you
are one of them, for your accent gives
you away."
74Then he began to call down curses on
himself and he swore to them, "I don't
know the man!"
75Immediately a rooster crowed. Then
Peter remembered the word Jesus had
spoken: "Before the rooster crows, you
will disown me three times." And he
went outside and wept bitterly.

---mt27.1-27.66 { (ch27)
1Early in the morning, all the chief
priests and the elders of the people
came to the decision to put Jesus to
death.
2They bound him, led him away and
handed him over to Pilate, the governor.
3When Judas, who had betrayed him,
saw that Jesus was condemned, he was
seized with remorse and returned the
thirty silver coins to the chief priests and
the elders.
4"I have sinned," he said, "for I have
betrayed innocent blood." "What is that
to us?" they replied. "That's your
responsibility."
5So Judas threw the money into the
temple and left. Then he went away and
hanged himself.
6The chief priests picked up the coins
and said, "It is against the law to put this
into the treasury, since it is blood
money."
7So they decided to use the money to
buy the potter's field as a burial place for
foreigners.
8That is why it has been called the Field
of Blood to this day.
9Then what was spoken by Jeremiah the
prophet was fulfilled: "They took the
thirty silver coins, the price set on him
by the people of Israel,
10and they used them to buy the potter's
field, as the Lord commanded me."
11Meanwhile Jesus stood before the
governor, and the governor asked him,
"Are you the king of the Jews?" "Yes, it
is as you say," Jesus replied.
12When he was accused by the chief
priests and the elders, he gave no
answer.
13Then Pilate asked him, "Don't you
hear the testimony they are bringing
against you?"
14But Jesus made no reply, not even to
a single charge--to the great
amazement of the governor.
15Now it was the governor's custom at
the Feast to release a prisoner chosen
by the crowd.
16At that time they had a notorious
prisoner, called Barabbas.
17So when the crowd had gathered,
Pilate asked them, "Which one do you
want me to release to you: Barabbas, or
Jesus who is called Christ?"
18For he knew it was out of envy that
they had handed Jesus over to him.
19While Pilate was sitting on the judge's
seat, his wife sent him this message:
"Don't have anything to do with that
innocent man, for I have suffered a
great deal today in a dream because of
him."
20But the chief priests and the elders
persuaded the crowd to ask for
Barabbas and to have Jesus executed.
21"Which of the two do you want me to
release to you?" asked the governor.
"Barabbas," they answered.
22"What shall I do, then, with Jesus who
is called Christ?" Pilate asked. They all
answered, "Crucify him!"
23"Why? What crime has he
committed?" asked Pilate. But they
shouted all the louder, "Crucify him!"
24When Pilate saw that he was getting
nowhere, but that instead an uproar was
starting, he took water and washed his
hands in front of the crowd. "I am
innocent of this man's blood," he said. "It
is your responsibility!"
25All the people answered, "Let his blood
be on us and on our children!"
26Then he released Barabbas to them.
But he had Jesus flogged, and handed
him over to be crucified.
27Then the governor's soldiers took
Jesus into the Praetorium and gathered
the whole company of soldiers around
him.
28They stripped him and put a scarlet
robe on him,
29and then twisted together a crown of
thorns and set it on his head. They put a
staff in his right hand and knelt in front
of him and mocked him. "Hail, king of
the Jews!" they said.
30They spit on him, and took the staff
and struck him on the head again and
again.
31After they had mocked him, they took
off the robe and put his own clothes on
him. Then they led him away to crucify
him.
32As they were going out, they met a
man from Cyrene, named Simon, and
they forced him to carry the cross.
33They came to a place called Golgotha
(which means The Place of the Skull).
34There they offered Jesus wine to drink,
mixed with gall; but after tasting it, he
refused to drink it.
35When they had crucified him, they
divided up his clothes by casting lots.
36And sitting down, they kept watch over
him there.
37Above his head they placed the written
charge against him:
38Two robbers were crucified with him,
one on his right and one on his left.
39Those who passed by hurled insults at
him, shaking their heads
40and saying, "You who are going to
destroy the temple and build it in three
days, save yourself! Come down from
the cross, if you are the Son of God!"
41In the same way the chief priests, the
teachers of the law and the elders
mocked him.
42"He saved others," they said, "but he
can't save himself! He's the King of
Israel! Let him come down now from the
cross, and we will believe in him.
43He trusts in God. Let God rescue him
now if he wants him, for he said, 'I am
the Son of God.' "
44In the same way the robbers who were
crucified with him also heaped insults on
him.
45From the sixth hour until the ninth hour
darkness came over all the land.
46About the ninth hour Jesus cried out in
a loud voice, "Eloi, Eloi, lama
sabachthani?"--which means, "My God,
my God, why have you forsaken me?"
47When some of those standing there
heard this, they said, "He's calling
Elijah."
48Immediately one of them ran and got a
sponge. He filled it with wine vinegar,
put it on a stick, and offered it to Jesus
to drink.
49The rest said, "Now leave him alone.
Let's see if Elijah comes to save him."
50And when Jesus had cried out again in
a loud voice, he gave up his spirit.
51At that moment the curtain of the
temple was torn in two from top to
bottom. The earth shook and the rocks
split.
52The tombs broke open and the bodies
of many holy people who had died were
raised to life.
53They came out of the tombs, and after
Jesus' resurrection they went into the
holy city and appeared to many people.
54When the centurion and those with
him who were guarding Jesus saw the
earthquake and all that had happened,
they were terrified, and exclaimed,
"Surely he was the Son of God!"
55Many women were there, watching
from a distance. They had followed
Jesus from Galilee to care for his needs.
56Among them were Mary Magdalene,
Mary the mother of James and Joses,
and the mother of Zebedee's sons.
57As evening approached, there came a
rich man from Arimathea, named
Joseph, who had himself become a
disciple of Jesus.
58Going to Pilate, he asked for Jesus'
body, and Pilate ordered that it be given
to him.
59Joseph took the body, wrapped it in a
clean linen cloth,
60and placed it in his own new tomb that
he had cut out of the rock. He rolled a
big stone in front of the entrance to the
tomb and went away.
61Mary Magdalene and the other Mary
were sitting there opposite the tomb.
62The next day, the one after
Preparation Day, the chief priests and
the Pharisees went to Pilate.
63"Sir," they said, "we remember that
while he was still alive that deceiver said,
'After three days I will rise again.'
64So give the order for the tomb to be
made secure until the third day.
Otherwise, his disciples may come and
steal the body and tell the people that
he has been raised from the dead. This
last deception will be worse than the
first."
65"Take a guard," Pilate answered. "Go,
make the tomb as secure as you know
how."
66So they went and made the tomb
secure by putting a seal on the stone
and posting the guard.
}

---mt28.1-28.20 { (ch28)
1After the Sabbath, at dawn on the
first day of the week, Mary Magdalene
and the other Mary went to look at the
tomb.
2There was a violent earthquake, for an
angel of the Lord came down from
heaven and, going to the tomb, rolled
back the stone and sat on it.
3His appearance was like lightning, and
his clothes were white as snow.
4The guards were so afraid of him that
they shook and became like dead men.
5The angel said to the women, "Do not
be afraid, for I know that you are looking
for Jesus, who was crucified.
6He is not here; he has risen, just as he
said. Come and see the place where he
lay.
7Then go quickly and tell his disciples:
'He has risen from the dead and is going
ahead of you into Galilee. There you will
see him.' Now I have told you."
8So the women hurried away from the
tomb, afraid yet filled with joy, and ran to
tell his disciples.
9Suddenly Jesus met them. "Greetings,"
he said. They came to him, clasped his
feet and worshiped him.
10Then Jesus said to them, "Do not be
afraid. Go and tell my brothers to go to
Galilee; there they will see me."
11While the women were on their way,
some of the guards went into the city
and reported to the chief priests
everything that had happened.
12When the chief priests had met with
the elders and devised a plan, they gave
the soldiers a large sum of money,
13telling them, "You are to say, 'His
disciples came during the night and
stole him away while we were asleep.'
14If this report gets to the governor, we
will satisfy him and keep you out of
trouble."
15So the soldiers took the money and
did as they were instructed. And this
story has been widely circulated among
the Jews to this very day.
16Then the eleven disciples went to
Galilee, to the mountain where Jesus
had told them to go.
17When they saw him, they worshiped
him; but some doubted.
18Then Jesus came to them and said,
"All authority in heaven and on earth has
been given to me.
19Therefore go and make disciples of all
nations, baptizing them in the name of
the Father and of the Son and of the
Holy Spirit,
20and teaching them to obey everything I
have commanded you. And surely I am
with you always, to the very end of the
age."

1 The beginning of the gospel about Jesus Christ, the Son of God.
2 It is written in Isaiah the prophet: "I will send my messenger ahead of you, who will prepare your way" --
3 "a voice of one calling in the desert, 'Prepare the way for the Lord, make straight paths for him.' "
4 And so John came, baptizing in the desert region and preaching a baptism of repentance for the forgiveness of sins.
5 The whole Judean countryside and all the people of Jerusalem went out to him.  Confessing their sins, they were baptized by him in the Jordan River.
6 John wore clothing made of camel's hair, with a leather belt around his waist, and he ate locusts and wild honey.
7 And this was his message: "After me will come one more powerful than I, the thongs of whose sandals I am not worthy to stoop down and untie.
8 I baptize you with water, but he will baptize you with the Holy Spirit."

9 At that time Jesus came from Nazareth in Galilee and was baptized by John in the Jordan.

11 And a voice came from heaven: "You are my Son, whom I love; with you I am well pleased."

14 After John was put in prison, Jesus went into Galilee, proclaiming the good news of God.
15 "The time has come," he said. "The kingdom of God is near. Repent and believe the good news!"
16 As Jesus walked beside the Sea of Galilee, he saw Simon and his brother Andrew casting a net into the lake, for they were fishermen.
17 "Come, follow me," Jesus said, "and I will make you fishers of men."
18 At once they left their nets and followed him.

19 When he had gone a little farther, he saw James son of Zebedee and his brother John in a boat, preparing their nets.

}

---mk1.23-1.28 { (jesusExorcism)
23 Just then a man in their synagogue who was possessed by an evil spirit cried out,
24 "What do you want with us, Jesus of Nazareth? Have you come to destroy us? I know who you are--the Holy One of God!"
25 "Be quiet!" said Jesus sternly. "Come out of him!"
26 The evil spirit shook the man violently and came out of him with a shriek.
27 The people were all so amazed that they asked each other, "What is this? A new teaching--and with authority! He even gives orders to evil spirits and they obey him."
28 News about him spread quickly over the whole region of Galilee.

---mk1.29-1.31 { (simonMotherInLaw)
29 As soon as they left the synagogue, they went with James and John to the home of Simon and Andrew.
30 Simon's mother-in-law was in bed with a fever, and they told Jesus about her.
31 So he went to her, took her hand and helped her up. The fever left her and she began to wait on them.
}

---mk1.32-1.34 { (jesusHeals)
32 That evening after sunset the people brought to Jesus all the sick and demonpossessed.
33 The whole town gathered at the door,
34 and Jesus healed many who had various diseases. He also drove out many demons, but he would not let the demons speak because they knew who he was.
}

---mk1.35-1.39 { (jesusPrays)
35 Very early in the morning, while it was still dark, Jesus got up, left the house and went off to a solitary place, where he prayed.
36 Simon and his companions went to look for him,
37 and when they found him, they exclaimed: "Everyone is looking for you!"
38 Jesus replied, "Let us go somewhere else--to the nearby villages--so I can preach there also. That is why I have come."
39 So he traveled throughout Galilee, preaching in their synagogues and driving out demons.

---mk1.40-1.45 { (leperHealed)
40 A man with leprosy came to him and begged him on his knees, "If you are willing, you can make me clean."
41 Filled with compassion, Jesus reached out his hand and touched the man. "I am willing," he said. "Be clean!"
42 Immediately the leprosy left him and he was cured.
43 Jesus sent him away at once with a strong warning:
44 "See that you don't tell this to anyone.  But go, show yourself to the priest and offer the sacrifices that Moses commanded for your cleansing, as a testimony to them."
45 Instead he went out and began to talk freely, spreading the news. As a result, Jesus could no longer enter a town openly but stayed outside in lonely places. Yet the people still came to him from everywhere.

---mk2.1-2.28 { (c2)
1 A few days later, when Jesus again entered Capernaum, the people heard that he had come home.
2 So many gathered that there was no room left, not even outside the door, and he preached the word to them.
3 Some men came, bringing to him a paralytic, carried by four of them.
4 Since they could not get him to Jesus because of the crowd, they made an opening in the roof above Jesus and, after digging through it, lowered the mat the paralyzed man was lying on.
5 When Jesus saw their faith, he said to the paralytic, "Son, your sins are forgiven."
6 Now some teachers of the law were sitting there, thinking to themselves,
7 "Why does this fellow talk like that?  He's blaspheming! Who can forgive sins but God alone?"
8 Immediately Jesus knew in his spirit that this was what they were thinking in their hearts, and he said to them, "Why are you thinking these things?
9 Which is easier: to say to the paralytic, 'Your sins are forgiven,' or to say, 'Get up, take your mat and walk'?
10 But that you may know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins . . . ." He said to the paralytic,
11 "I tell you, get up, take your mat and go home."
12 He got up, took his mat and walked out in full view of them all. This amazed everyone and they praised God, saying, "We have never seen anything like this!"
13 Once again Jesus went out beside the lake. A large crowd came to him, and he began to teach them.
14 As he walked along, he saw Levi son of Alphaeus sitting at the tax collector's booth. "Follow me," Jesus told him, and Levi got up and followed him.
15 While Jesus was having dinner at Levi's house, many tax collectors and "sinners" were eating with him and his disciples, for there were many who followed him.
16 When the teachers of the law who were Pharisees saw him eating with the "sinners" and tax collectors, they asked his disciples: "Why does he eat with tax collectors and 'sinners'?"
17 On hearing this, Jesus said to them, "It is not the healthy who need a doctor, but the sick. I have not come to call the righteous, but sinners."
18 Now John's disciples and the Pharisees were fasting. Some people came and asked Jesus, "How is it that John's disciples and the disciples of the Pharisees are fasting, but yours are not?"
19 Jesus answered, "How can the guests of the bridegroom fast while he is with them? They cannot, so long as they have him with them.
20 But the time will come when the bridegroom will be taken from them, and on that day they will fast.
21 "No one sews a patch of unshrunk cloth on an old garment. If he does, the new piece will pull away from the old, making the tear worse.
22 And no one pours new wine into old wineskins. If he does, the wine will burst the skins, and both the wine and the wineskins will be ruined. No, he pours new wine into new wineskins."
23 One Sabbath Jesus was going through the grainfields, and as his disciples walked along, they began to pick some heads of grain.
24 The Pharisees said to him, "Look, why are they doing what is unlawful on the Sabbath?"
25 He answered, "Have you never read what David did when he and his companions were hungry and in need?
26 In the days of Abiathar the high priest, he entered the house of God and ate the consecrated bread, which is lawful only for priests to eat. And he also gave some to his companions."
27 Then he said to them, "The Sabbath was made for man, not man for the Sabbath.
28 So the Son of Man is Lord even of the Sabbath."

---mk3.1-3.35 { (c3)
1 Another time he went into the synagogue, and a man with a shriveled hand was there.
2 Some of them were looking for a reason to accuse Jesus, so they watched him closely to see if he would heal him on the Sabbath.
3 Jesus said to the man with the shriveled hand, "Stand up in front of everyone."
4 Then Jesus asked them, "Which is lawful on the Sabbath: to do good or to do evil, to save life or to kill?" But they remained silent.
5 He looked around at them in anger and, deeply distressed at their stubborn hearts, said to the man, "Stretch out your hand." He stretched it out, and his hand was completely restored.
6 Then the Pharisees went out and began to plot with the Herodians how they might kill Jesus.
7 Jesus withdrew with his disciples to the lake, and a large crowd from Galilee followed.
8 When they heard all he was doing, many people came to him from Judea, Jerusalem, Idumea, and the regions across the Jordan and around Tyre and Sidon.
9 Because of the crowd he told his disciples to have a small boat ready for him, to keep the people from crowding him.
10 For he had healed many, so that those with diseases were pushing forward to touch him.
11 Whenever the evil spirits saw him, they fell down before him and cried out, "You are the Son of God."
12 But he gave them strict orders not to tell who he was.
13 Jesus went up on a mountainside and called to him those he wanted, and they came to him.
14 He appointed twelve--designating them apostles --that they might be with him and that he might send them out to preach
15 and to have authority to drive out demons.
16 These are the twelve he appointed: Simon (to whom he gave the name Peter);
17 James son of Zebedee and his brother John (to them he gave the name Boanerges, which means Sons of Thunder);
18 Andrew, Philip, Bartholomew, Matthew, Thomas, James son of Alphaeus, Thaddaeus, Simon the Zealot
19 and Judas Iscariot, who betrayed him.
20 Then Jesus entered a house, and again a crowd gathered, so that he and his disciples were not even able to eat.
21 When his family heard about this, they went to take charge of him, for they said, "He is out of his mind."
22 And the teachers of the law who came down from Jerusalem said, "He is possessed by Beelzebub ! By the prince of demons he is driving out demons."
23 So Jesus called them and spoke to them in parables: "How can Satan drive out Satan?
24 If a kingdom is divided against itself, that kingdom cannot stand.
25 If a house is divided against itself, that house cannot stand.
26 And if Satan opposes himself and is divided, he cannot stand; his end has come.
27 In fact, no one can enter a strong man's house and carry off his possessions unless he first ties up the strong man. Then he can rob his house.
28 I tell you the truth, all the sins and blasphemies of men will be forgiven them.
29 But whoever blasphemes against the Holy Spirit will never be forgiven; he is guilty of an eternal sin."
30 He said this because they were saying, "He has an evil spirit."
31 Then Jesus' mother and brothers arrived. Standing outside, they sent someone in to call him.
32 A crowd was sitting around him, and they told him, "Your mother and brothers are outside looking for you."
33 "Who are my mother and my brothers?" he asked.
34 Then he looked at those seated in a circle around him and said, "Here are my mother and my brothers!
35 Whoever does God's will is my brother and sister and mother."

---mk4.1-4.41 { (c4)
1 Again Jesus began to teach by the lake. The crowd that gathered around him was so large that he got into a boat and sat in it out on the lake, while all the people were along the shore at the water's edge.
2 He taught them many things by parables, and in his teaching said:
3 "Listen! A farmer went out to sow his seed.
4 As he was scattering the seed, some fell along the path, and the birds came and ate it up.
5 Some fell on rocky places, where it did not have much soil. It sprang up quickly, because the soil was shallow.
6 But when the sun came up, the plants were scorched, and they withered because they had no root.
7 Other seed fell among thorns, which grew up and choked the plants, so that they did not bear grain.
8 Still other seed fell on good soil. It came up, grew and produced a crop, multiplying thirty, sixty, or even a hundred times."
9 Then Jesus said, "He who has ears to hear, let him hear."
10 When he was alone, the Twelve and the others around him asked him about the parables.
11 He told them, "The secret of the kingdom of God has been given to you.  But to those on the outside everything is said in parables
12 so that, " 'they may be ever seeing but never perceiving, and ever hearing but never understanding; otherwise they might turn and be forgiven!' "
13 Then Jesus said to them, "Don't you understand this parable? How then will you understand any parable?
14 The farmer sows the word.
15 Some people are like seed along the path, where the word is sown. As soon as they hear it, Satan comes and takes away the word that was sown in them.
16 Others, like seed sown on rocky places, hear the word and at once receive it with joy.
17 But since they have no root, they last only a short time. When trouble or persecution comes because of the word, they quickly fall away.
18 Still others, like seed sown among thorns, hear the word;
19 but the worries of this life, the deceitfulness of wealth and the desires for other things come in and choke the word, making it unfruitful.
20 Others, like seed sown on good soil, hear the word, accept it, and produce a crop--thirty, sixty or even a hundred times what was sown."
21 He said to them, "Do you bring in a lamp to put it under a bowl or a bed?  Instead, don't you put it on its stand?
22 For whatever is hidden is meant to be disclosed, and whatever is concealed is meant to be brought out into the open.
23 If anyone has ears to hear, let him hear."
24 "Consider carefully what you hear," he continued. "With the measure you use, it will be measured to you--and even more.
25 Whoever has will be given more; whoever does not have, even what he has will be taken from him."
26 He also said, "This is what the kingdom of God is like. A man scatters seed on the ground.
27 Night and day, whether he sleeps or gets up, the seed sprouts and grows, though he does not know how.
28 All by itself the soil produces grain-- first the stalk, then the head, then the full kernel in the head.
29 As soon as the grain is ripe, he puts the sickle to it, because the harvest has come."
30 Again he said, "What shall we say the kingdom of God is like, or what parable shall we use to describe it?
31 It is like a mustard seed, which is the smallest seed you plant in the ground.
32 Yet when planted, it grows and becomes the largest of all garden plants, with such big branches that the birds of the air can perch in its shade."
33 With many similar parables Jesus spoke the word to them, as much as they could understand.
34 He did not say anything to them without using a parable. But when he was alone with his own disciples, he explained everything.
35 That day when evening came, he said to his disciples, "Let us go over to the other side."
36 Leaving the crowd behind, they took him along, just as he was, in the boat.  There were also other boats with him.
37 A furious squall came up, and the waves broke over the boat, so that it was nearly swamped.
38 Jesus was in the stern, sleeping on a cushion. The disciples woke him and said to him, "Teacher, don't you care if we drown?"
39 He got up, rebuked the wind and said to the waves, "Quiet! Be still!" Then the wind died down and it was completely calm.
40 He said to his disciples, "Why are you so afraid? Do you still have no faith?"
41 They were terrified and asked each other, "Who is this? Even the wind and the waves obey him!"

1 They went across the lake to the region of the Gerasenes.
2 When Jesus got out of the boat, a man with an evil spirit came from the tombs to meet him.
3 This man lived in the tombs, and no one could bind him any more, not even with a chain.
4 For he had often been chained hand and foot, but he tore the chains apart and broke the irons on his feet. No one was strong enough to subdue him.
5 Night and day among the tombs and in the hills he would cry out and cut himself with stones.
6 When he saw Jesus from a distance, he ran and fell on his knees in front of him.
7 He shouted at the top of his voice, "What do you want with me, Jesus, Son of the Most High God? Swear to God that you won't torture me!"
8 For Jesus had said to him, "Come out of this man, you evil spirit!"
9 Then Jesus asked him, "What is your name?"
10 "My name is Legion," he replied, "for we are many." And he begged Jesus again and again not to send them out of the area.
11 A large herd of pigs was feeding on the nearby hillside.
12 The demons begged Jesus, "Send us among the pigs; allow us to go into them."
13 He gave them permission, and the evil spirits came out and went into the pigs.  The herd, about two thousand in number, rushed down the steep bank into the lake and were drowned.
14 Those tending the pigs ran off and reported this in the town and countryside, and the people went out to see what had happened.
15 When they came to Jesus, they saw the man who had been possessed by the legion of demons, sitting there, dressed and in his right mind; and they were afraid.
16 Those who had seen it told the people what had happened to the demonpossessed man--and told about the pigs as well.
17 Then the people began to plead with Jesus to leave their region.
18 As Jesus was getting into the boat, the man who had been demon-possessed begged to go with him.
19 Jesus did not let him, but said, "Go home to your family and tell them how much the Lord has done for you, and how he has had mercy on you."
20 So the man went away and began to tell in the Decapolis how much Jesus had done for him. And all the people were amazed.
21 When Jesus had again crossed over by boat to the other side of the lake, a large crowd gathered around him while he was by the lake.
22 Then one of the synagogue rulers, named Jairus, came there. Seeing Jesus, he fell at his feet
23 and pleaded earnestly with him, "My little daughter is dying. Please come and put your hands on her so that she will be healed and live."
24 So Jesus went with him.
25 A large crowd followed and pressed around him. And a woman was there who had been subject to bleeding for twelve years.
26 She had suffered a great deal under the care of many doctors and had spent all she had, yet instead of getting better she grew worse.
27 When she heard about Jesus, she came up behind him in the crowd and touched his cloak,
28 because she thought, "If I just touch his clothes, I will be healed."
29 Immediately her bleeding stopped and she felt in her body that she was freed from her suffering.
30 At once Jesus realized that power had gone out from him. He turned around in the crowd and asked, "Who touched my clothes?"
31 "You see the people crowding against you," his disciples answered, "and yet you can ask, 'Who touched me?' "
32 But Jesus kept looking around to see who had done it.
33 Then the woman, knowing what had happened to her, came and fell at his feet and, trembling with fear, told him the whole truth.
34 He said to her, "Daughter, your faith has healed you. Go in peace and be freed from your suffering."
35 While Jesus was still speaking, some men came from the house of Jairus, the synagogue ruler. "Your daughter is dead," they said. "Why bother the teacher any more?"
36 Ignoring what they said, Jesus told the synagogue ruler, "Don't be afraid; just believe."
37 He did not let anyone follow him except Peter, James and John the brother of James.
38 When they came to the home of the synagogue ruler, Jesus saw a commotion, with people crying and wailing loudly.
39 He went in and said to them, "Why all this commotion and wailing? The child is not dead but asleep."
40 But they laughed at him.
41 After he put them all out, he took the child's father and mother and the disciples who were with him, and went in where the child was. He took her by the hand and said to her, "Talitha koum!" (which means, "Little girl, I say to you, get up!" ).
42 Immediately the girl stood up and walked around (she was twelve years old). At this they were completely astonished.
43 He gave strict orders not to let anyone know about this, and told them to give her something to eat.

1 Jesus left there and went to his hometown, accompanied by his disciples.
2 When the Sabbath came, he began to teach in the synagogue, and many who heard him were amazed.
3 "Where did this man get these things?" they asked. "What's this wisdom that has been given him, that he even does miracles! Isn't this the carpenter? Isn't this Mary's son and the brother of James, Joseph, Judas and Simon?  Aren't his sisters here with us?" And they took offense at him.
4 Jesus said to them, "Only in his hometown, among his relatives and in his own house is a prophet without honor."
5 He could not do any miracles there, except lay his hands on a few sick people and heal them.
6 And he was amazed at their lack of faith.
7 Then Jesus went around teaching from village to village. Calling the Twelve to him, he sent them out two by two and gave them authority over evil spirits.
8 These were his instructions: "Take nothing for the journey except a staff--no bread, no bag, no money in your belts.
9 Wear sandals but not an extra tunic.
10 Whenever you enter a house, stay there until you leave that town.
11 And if any place will not welcome you or listen to you, shake the dust off your feet when you leave, as a testimony against them."
12 They went out and preached that people should repent.
13 They drove out many demons and anointed many sick people with oil and healed them.
14 King Herod heard about this, for Jesus' name had become well known. Some were saying, "John the Baptist has been raised from the dead, and that is why miraculous powers are at work in him."
15 Others said, "He is Elijah." And still others claimed, "He is a prophet, like one of the prophets of long ago."
16 But when Herod heard this, he said, "John, the man I beheaded, has been raised from the dead!"
17 For Herod himself had given orders to have John arrested, and he had him bound and put in prison. He did this because of Herodias, his brother Philip's wife, whom he had married.
18 For John had been saying to Herod, "It is not lawful for you to have your brother's wife."
19 So Herodias nursed a grudge against John and wanted to kill him. But she was not able to,
20 because Herod feared John and protected him, knowing him to be a righteous and holy man. When Herod heard John, he was greatly puzzled ; yet he liked to listen to him.
21 Finally the opportune time came. On his birthday Herod gave a banquet for his high officials and military commanders and the leading men of Galilee.
22 When the daughter of Herodias came in and danced, she pleased Herod and his dinner guests.
23 The king said to the girl, "Ask me for anything you want, and I'll give it to you." And he promised her with an oath, "Whatever you ask I will give you, up to half my kingdom."
24 She went out and said to her mother, "What shall I ask for?" "The head of John the Baptist," she answered.
25 At once the girl hurried in to the king with the request: "I want you to give me right now the head of John the Baptist on a platter."
26 The king was greatly distressed, but because of his oaths and his dinner guests, he did not want to refuse her.
27 So he immediately sent an executioner with orders to bring John's head. The man went, beheaded John in the prison,
28 and brought back his head on a platter.  He presented it to the girl, and she gave it to her mother.
29 On hearing of this, John's disciples came and took his body and laid it in a tomb.
30 The apostles gathered around Jesus and reported to him all they had done and taught.
31 Then, because so many people were coming and going that they did not even have a chance to eat, he said to them, "Come with me by yourselves to a quiet place and get some rest."
32 So they went away by themselves in a boat to a solitary place.
33 But many who saw them leaving recognized them and ran on foot from all the towns and got there ahead of them.
34 When Jesus landed and saw a large crowd, he had compassion on them, because they were like sheep without a shepherd. So he began teaching them many things.
35 By this time it was late in the day, so his disciples came to him. "This is a remote place," they said, "and it's already very late.
36 Send the people away so they can go to the surrounding countryside and villages and buy themselves something to eat."
37 But he answered, "You give them something to eat." They said to him, "That would take eight months of a man's wages ! Are we to go and spend that much on bread and give it to them to eat?"
38 "How many loaves do you have?" he asked. "Go and see." When they found out, they said, "Five--and two fish."
39 Then Jesus directed them to have all the people sit down in groups on the green grass.
40 So they sat down in groups of hundreds and fifties.
41 Taking the five loaves and the two fish and looking up to heaven, he gave thanks and broke the loaves. Then he gave them to his disciples to set before the people. He also divided the two fish among them all.
42 They all ate and were satisfied,
43 and the disciples picked up twelve basketfuls of broken pieces of bread and fish.
44 The number of the men who had eaten was five thousand.
45 Immediately Jesus made his disciples get into the boat and go on ahead of him to Bethsaida, while he dismissed the crowd.
46 After leaving them, he went up on a mountainside to pray.
47 When evening came, the boat was in the middle of the lake, and he was alone on land.
48 He saw the disciples straining at the oars, because the wind was against them. About the fourth watch of the night he went out to them, walking on the lake. He was about to pass by them,
49 but when they saw him walking on the lake, they thought he was a ghost. They cried out,
50 because they all saw him and were terrified.
51 Immediately he spoke to them and said, "Take courage! It is I. Don't be afraid." Then he climbed into the boat with them, and the wind died down.  They were completely amazed,
52 for they had not understood about the loaves; their hearts were hardened.
53 When they had crossed over, they landed at Gennesaret and anchored there.
54 As soon as they got out of the boat, people recognized Jesus.
55 They ran throughout that whole region and carried the sick on mats to wherever they heard he was.
56 And wherever he went--into villages, towns or countryside--they placed the sick in the marketplaces. They begged him to let them touch even the edge of his cloak, and all who touched him were healed.

---mk7.1-7.37 { (c7)
1 The Pharisees and some of the teachers of the law who had come from Jerusalem gathered around Jesus and
2 saw some of his disciples eating food with hands that were "unclean," that is, unwashed.
3 (The Pharisees and all the Jews do not eat unless they give their hands a ceremonial washing, holding to the tradition of the elders.
4 When they come from the marketplace they do not eat unless they wash. And they observe many other traditions, such as the washing of cups, pitchers and kettles. )
5 So the Pharisees and teachers of the law asked Jesus, "Why don't your disciples live according to the tradition of the elders instead of eating their food with 'unclean' hands?"
6 He replied, "Isaiah was right when he prophesied about you hypocrites; as it is written: " 'These people honor me with their lips, but their hearts are far from me.
7 They worship me in vain; their teachings are but rules taught by men.'
8 You have let go of the commands of God and are holding on to the traditions of men."
9 And he said to them: "You have a fine way of setting aside the commands of God in order to observe your own traditions!
10 For Moses said, 'Honor your father and your mother,' and, 'Anyone who curses his father or mother must be put to death.'
11 But you say that if a man says to his father or mother: 'Whatever help you might otherwise have received from me is Corban' (that is, a gift devoted to God),
12 then you no longer let him do anything for his father or mother.
13 Thus you nullify the word of God by your tradition that you have handed down. And you do many things like that."
14 Again Jesus called the crowd to him and said, "Listen to me, everyone, and understand this.
15 Nothing outside a man can make him 'unclean' by going into him. Rather, it is what comes out of a man that makes
hi m 'unclean.' "
17 After he had left the crowd and entered the house, his disciples asked him about this parable.
18 "Are you so dull?" he asked. "Don't you see that nothing that enters a man from the outside can make him 'unclean'?
19 For it doesn't go into his heart but into his stomach, and then out of his body." (In saying this, Jesus declared all foods "clean.")
20 He went on: "What comes out of a man is what makes him 'unclean.'
21 For from within, out of men's hearts, come evil thoughts, sexual immorality, theft, murder, adultery,
22 greed, malice, deceit, lewdness, envy, slander, arrogance and folly.
23 All these evils come from inside and make a man 'unclean.' "
24 Jesus left that place and went to the vicinity of Tyre. He entered a house and did not want anyone to know it; yet he could not keep his presence secret.
25 In fact, as soon as she heard about him, a woman whose little daughter was possessed by an evil spirit came and fell at his feet.
26 The woman was a Greek, born in Syrian Phoenicia. She begged Jesus to drive the demon out of her daughter.
27 "First let the children eat all they want," he told her, "for it is not right to take the children's bread and toss it to their dogs."
28 "Yes, Lord," she replied, "but even the dogs under the table eat the children's crumbs."
29 Then he told her, "For such a reply, you may go; the demon has left your daughter."
30 She went home and found her child lying on the bed, and the demon gone.
31 Then Jesus left the vicinity of Tyre and went through Sidon, down to the Sea of Galilee and into the region of the Decapolis.
32 There some people brought to him a man who was deaf and could hardly talk, and they begged him to place his hand on the man.
33 After he took him aside, away from the crowd, Jesus put his fingers into the man's ears. Then he spit and touched the man's tongue.
34 He looked up to heaven and with a deep sigh said to him, "Ephphatha!" (which means, "Be opened!" ).
35 At this, the man's ears were opened, his tongue was loosened and he began to speak plainly.
36 Jesus commanded them not to tell anyone. But the more he did so, the more they kept talking about it.
37 People were overwhelmed with amazement. "He has done everything well," they said. "He even makes the deaf hear and the mute speak."

---mk8.1-8.38 { (c8)
1 During those days another large crowd gathered. Since they had nothing to eat, Jesus called his disciples to him and said,
2 "I have compassion for these people; they have already been with me three days and have nothing to eat.
3 If I send them home hungry, they will collapse on the way, because some of them have come a long distance."
4 His disciples answered, "But where in this remote place can anyone get enough bread to feed them?"
5 "How many loaves do you have?" Jesus asked. "Seven," they replied.
6 He told the crowd to sit down on the ground. When he had taken the seven loaves and given thanks, he broke them and gave them to his disciples to set before the people, and they did so.
7 They had a few small fish as well; he gave thanks for them also and told the disciples to distribute them.
8 The people ate and were satisfied.  Afterward the disciples picked up seven basketfuls of broken pieces that were left over.
9 About four thousand men were present.  And having sent them away,
10 he got into the boat with his disciples and went to the region of Dalmanutha.
11 The Pharisees came and began to question Jesus. To test him, they asked him for a sign from heaven.
12 He sighed deeply and said, "Why does this generation ask for a miraculous sign? I tell you the truth, no sign will be given to it."
13 Then he left them, got back into the boat and crossed to the other side.
14 The disciples had forgotten to bring bread, except for one loaf they had with them in the boat.
15 "Be careful," Jesus warned them.  "Watch out for the yeast of the Pharisees and that of Herod."
16 They discussed this with one another and said, "It is because we have no bread."
17 Aware of their discussion, Jesus asked them: "Why are you talking about having no bread? Do you still not see or understand? Are your hearts hardened?
18 Do you have eyes but fail to see, and ears but fail to hear? And don't you remember?
19 When I broke the five loaves for the five thousand, how many basketfuls of pieces did you pick up?" "Twelve," they replied.
20 "And when I broke the seven loaves for the four thousand, how many basketfuls of pieces did you pick up?" They answered, "Seven."
21 He said to them, "Do you still not understand?"
22 They came to Bethsaida, and some people brought a blind man and begged Jesus to touch him.
23 He took the blind man by the hand and led him outside the village. When he had spit on the man's eyes and put his hands on him, Jesus asked, "Do you see anything?"
24 He looked up and said, "I see people; they look like trees walking around."
25 Once more Jesus put his hands on the man's eyes. Then his eyes were opened, his sight was restored, and he saw everything clearly.
26 Jesus sent him home, saying, "Don't go into the village. "
27 Jesus and his disciples went on to the villages around Caesarea Philippi. On the way he asked them, "Who do people say I am?"
28 They replied, "Some say John the Baptist; others say Elijah; and still others, one of the prophets."
29 "But what about you?" he asked. "Who do you say I am?" Peter answered, "You are the Christ. "
30 Jesus warned them not to tell anyone about him.
31 He then began to teach them that the Son of Man must suffer many things and be rejected by the elders, chief priests and teachers of the law, and that he must be killed and after three days rise again.
32 He spoke plainly about this, and Peter took him aside and began to rebuke him.
33 But when Jesus turned and looked at his disciples, he rebuked Peter. "Get behind me, Satan!" he said. "You do not have in mind the things of God, but the things of men."
34 Then he called the crowd to him along with his disciples and said: "If anyone would come after me, he must deny himself and take up his cross and follow me.
35 For whoever wants to save his life will lose it, but whoever loses his life for me and for the gospel will save it.
36 What good is it for a man to gain the whole world, yet forfeit his soul?
37 Or what can a man give in exchange for his soul?
38 If anyone is ashamed of me and my words in this adulterous and sinful generation, the Son of Man will be ashamed of him when he comes in his Father's glory with the holy angels."

1 And he said to them, "I tell you the truth, some who are standing here will not taste death before they see the kingdom of God come with power."
2 After six days Jesus took Peter, James and John with him and led them up a high mountain, where they were all alone. There he was transfigured before them.
3 His clothes became dazzling white, whiter than anyone in the world could bleach them.
4 And there appeared before them Elijah and Moses, who were talking with Jesus.
5 Peter said to Jesus, "Rabbi, it is good for us to be here. Let us put up three shelters--one for you, one for Moses and one for Elijah."
6 (He did not know what to say, they were so frightened.)
7 Then a cloud appeared and enveloped them, and a voice came from the cloud: "This is my Son, whom I love. Listen to him!"
8 Suddenly, when they looked around, they no longer saw anyone with them except Jesus.
9 As they were coming down the mountain, Jesus gave them orders not to tell anyone what they had seen until the Son of Man had risen from the dead.
10 They kept the matter to themselves, discussing what "rising from the dead" meant.
11 And they asked him, "Why do the teachers of the law say that Elijah must come first?"
12 Jesus replied, "To be sure, Elijah does come first, and restores all things. Why then is it written that the Son of Man must suffer much and be rejected?
13 But I tell you, Elijah has come, and they have done to him everything they wished, just as it is written about him."
14 When they came to the other disciples, they saw a large crowd around them and the teachers of the law arguing with them.
15 As soon as all the people saw Jesus, they were overwhelmed with wonder and ran to greet him.
16 "What are you arguing with them about?" he asked.
17 A man in the crowd answered, "Teacher, I brought you my son, who is possessed by a spirit that has robbed him of speech.
18 Whenever it seizes him, it throws him to the ground. He foams at the mouth, gnashes his teeth and becomes rigid. I asked your disciples to drive out the spirit, but they could not."
19 "O unbelieving generation," Jesus replied, "how long shall I stay with you?  How long shall I put up with you? Bring the boy to me."
20 So they brought him. When the spirit saw Jesus, it immediately threw the boy into a convulsion. He fell to the ground and rolled around, foaming at the mouth.
21 Jesus asked the boy's father, "How long has he been like this?"
22 "From childhood," he answered. "It has often thrown him into fire or water to kill him. But if you can do anything, take pity on us and help us."
23 " 'If you can'?" said Jesus. "Everything is possible for him who believes."
24 Immediately the boy's father exclaimed, "I do believe; help me overcome my unbelief!"
25 When Jesus saw that a crowd was running to the scene, he rebuked the evil spirit. "You deaf and mute spirit," he said, "I command you, come out of him and never enter him again."
26 The spirit shrieked, convulsed him violently and came out. The boy looked so much like a corpse that many said, "He's dead."
27 But Jesus took him by the hand and lifted him to his feet, and he stood up.
28 After Jesus had gone indoors, his disciples asked him privately, "Why couldn't we drive it out?"
29 He replied, "This kind can come out only by prayer. "
30 They left that place and passed through Galilee. Jesus did not want anyone to know where they were,
31 because he was teaching his disciples.  He said to them, "The Son of Man is going to be betrayed into the hands of men. They will kill him, and after three days he will rise."
32 But they did not understand what he meant and were afraid to ask him about it.
33 They came to Capernaum. When he was in the house, he asked them, "What were you arguing about on the road?"
34 But they kept quiet because on the way they had argued about who was the greatest.
35 Sitting down, Jesus called the Twelve and said, "If anyone wants to be first, he must be the very last, and the servant of all."
36 He took a little child and had him stand among them. Taking him in his arms, he said to them,
37 "Whoever welcomes one of these little children in my name welcomes me; and whoever welcomes me does not welcome me but the one who sent me."
38 "Teacher," said John, "we saw a man driving out demons in your name and we told him to stop, because he was not one of us."
39 "Do not stop him," Jesus said. "No one who does a miracle in my name can in the next moment say anything bad about me,
40 for whoever is not against us is for us.
41 I tell you the truth, anyone who gives you a cup of water in my name because you belong to Christ will certainly not lose his reward.
42 "And if anyone causes one of these little ones who believe in me to sin, it would be better for him to be thrown into the sea with a large millstone tied around his neck.
43 If your hand causes you to sin, cut it off. It is better for you to enter life maimed than with two hands to go into hell, where the fire never goes out.
45 And if your foot causes you to sin, cut it off. It is better for you to enter life crippled than to have two feet and be thrown into hell.
47 And if your eye causes you to sin, pluck it out. It is better for you to enter the kingdom of God with one eye than to have two eyes and be thrown into hell,
48 where " 'their worm does not die, and the fire is not quenched.'
49 Everyone will be salted with fire.
50 "Salt is good, but if it loses its saltiness, how can you make it salty again? Have salt in yourselves, and be at peace with each other."

1 Jesus then left that place and went into the region of Judea and across the Jordan. Again crowds of people came to him, and as was his custom, he taught them.
2 Some Pharisees came and tested him by asking, "Is it lawful for a man to divorce his wife?"
3 "What did Moses command you?" he replied.
4 They said, "Moses permitted a man to write a certificate of divorce and send her away."
5 "It was because your hearts were hard that Moses wrote you this law," Jesus replied.
6 "But at the beginning of creation God 'made them male and female.'
7 'For this reason a man will leave his father and mother and be united to his wife,
8 and the two will become one flesh.' So they are no longer two, but one.
9 Therefore what God has joined together, let man not separate."
10 When they were in the house again, the disciples asked Jesus about this.
11 He answered, "Anyone who divorces his wife and marries another woman commits adultery against her.
12 And if she divorces her husband and marries another man, she commits adultery."
13 People were bringing little children to Jesus to have him touch them, but the disciples rebuked them.
14 When Jesus saw this, he was indignant. He said to them, "Let the little children come to me, and do not hinder them, for the kingdom of God belongs to such as these.
15 I tell you the truth, anyone who will not receive the kingdom of God like a little child will never enter it."
16 And he took the children in his arms, put his hands on them and blessed them.
17 As Jesus started on his way, a man ran up to him and fell on his knees before him. "Good teacher," he asked, "what must I do to inherit eternal life?"
18 "Why do you call me good?" Jesus answered. "No one is good--except God alone.
19 You know the commandments: 'Do not murder, do not commit adultery, do not steal, do not give false testimony, do not defraud, honor your father and mother.'"
20 "Teacher," he declared, "all these I have kept since I was a boy."
21 Jesus looked at him and loved him.  "One thing you lack," he said. "Go, sell everything you have and give to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven. Then come, follow me."
22 At this the man's face fell. He went away sad, because he had great wealth.
23 Jesus looked around and said to his disciples, "How hard it is for the rich to enter the kingdom of God!"
24 The disciples were amazed at his words. But Jesus said again, "Children, how hard it is to enter the kingdom of God!
25 It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of God."
26 The disciples were even more amazed, and said to each other, "Who then can be saved?"
27 Jesus looked at them and said, "With man this is impossible, but not with God; all things are possible with God."
28 Peter said to him, "We have left everything to follow you!"
29 "I tell you the truth," Jesus replied, "no one who has left home or brothers or sisters or mother or father or children or fields for me and the gospel
30 will fail to receive a hundred times as much in this present age (homes, brothers, sisters, mothers, children and fields--and with them, persecutions) and in the age to come, eternal life.
31 But many who are first will be last, and the last first."
32 They were on their way up to Jerusalem, with Jesus leading the way, and the disciples were astonished, while those who followed were afraid. Again he took the Twelve aside and told them what was going to happen to him.
33 "We are going up to Jerusalem," he said, "and the Son of Man will be betrayed to the chief priests and teachers of the law. They will condemn him to death and will hand him over to the Gentiles,
34 who will mock him and spit on him, flog him and kill him. Three days later he will rise."
35 Then James and John, the sons of Zebedee, came to him. "Teacher," they said, "we want you to do for us whatever we ask."
36 "What do you want me to do for you?" he asked.
37 They replied, "Let one of us sit at your right and the other at your left in your glory."
38 "You don't know what you are asking," Jesus said. "Can you drink the cup I drink or be baptized with the baptism I am baptized with?"
39 "We can," they answered. Jesus said to them, "You will drink the cup I drink and be baptized with the baptism I am baptized with,
40 but to sit at my right or left is not for me to grant. These places belong to those for whom they have been prepared."
41 When the ten heard about this, they became indignant with James and John.
42 Jesus called them together and said, "You know that those who are regarded as rulers of the Gentiles lord it over them, and their high officials exercise authority over them.
43 Not so with you. Instead, whoever wants to become great among you must be your servant,
44 and whoever wants to be first must be slave of all.
45 For even the Son of Man did not come to be served, but to serve, and to give his life as a ransom for many."
46 Then they came to Jericho. As Jesus and his disciples, together with a large crowd, were leaving the city, a blind man, Bartimaeus (that is, the Son of Timaeus), was sitting by the roadside begging.
47 When he heard that it was Jesus of Nazareth, he began to shout, "Jesus, Son of David, have mercy on me!"
48 Many rebuked him and told him to be quiet, but he shouted all the more, "Son of David, have mercy on me!"
49 Jesus stopped and said, "Call him." So they called to the blind man, "Cheer up!  On your feet! He's calling you."
50 Throwing his cloak aside, he jumped to his feet and came to Jesus.
51 "What do you want me to do for you?" Jesus asked him. The blind man said, "Rabbi, I want to see."
52 "Go," said Jesus, "your faith has healed you." Immediately he received his sight and followed Jesus along the road.

1 As they approached Jerusalem and came to Bethphage and Bethany at the Mount of Olives, Jesus sent two of his disciples,
2 saying to them, "Go to the village ahead of you, and just as you enter it, you will find a colt tied there, which no one has ever ridden. Untie it and bring it here.
3 If anyone asks you, 'Why are you doing this?' tell him, 'The Lord needs it and will send it back here shortly.' "
4 They went and found a colt outside in the street, tied at a doorway. As they untied it,
5 some people standing there asked, "What are you doing, untying that colt?"
6 They answered as Jesus had told them to, and the people let them go.
7 When they brought the colt to Jesus and threw their cloaks over it, he sat on it.
8 Many people spread their cloaks on the road, while others spread branches they had cut in the fields.
9 Those who went ahead and those who followed shouted, "Hosanna! " "Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord!"
10 "Blessed is the coming kingdom of our father David!" "Hosanna in the highest!"
11 Jesus entered Jerusalem and went to the temple. He looked around at everything, but since it was already late, he went out to Bethany with the Twelve.
12 The next day as they were leaving Bethany, Jesus was hungry.
13 Seeing in the distance a fig tree in leaf, he went to find out if it had any fruit.  When he reached it, he found nothing but leaves, because it was not the season for figs.
14 Then he said to the tree, "May no one ever eat fruit from you again." And his disciples heard him say it.
15 On reaching Jerusalem, Jesus entered the temple area and began driving out those who were buying and selling there.  He overturned the tables of the money changers and the benches of those selling doves,
16 and would not allow anyone to carry merchandise through the temple courts.
17 And as he taught them, he said, "Is it not written: " 'My house will be called a house of prayer for all nations' ? But you have made it 'a den of robbers.' "
18 The chief priests and the teachers of the law heard this and began looking for a way to kill him, for they feared him, because the whole crowd was amazed at his teaching.
19 When evening came, they went out of the city.
20 In the morning, as they went along, they saw the fig tree withered from the roots.
21 Peter remembered and said to Jesus, "Rabbi, look! The fig tree you cursed has withered!"
22 "Have faith in God," Jesus answered.
23 "I tell you the truth, if anyone says to this mountain, 'Go, throw yourself into the sea,' and does not doubt in his heart but believes that what he says will happen, it will be done for him.
24 Therefore I tell you, whatever you ask for in prayer, believe that you have received it, and it will be yours.
25 And when you stand praying, if you hold anything against anyone, forgive him, so that your Father in heaven may forgive you your sins."
27 They arrived again in Jerusalem, and while Jesus was walking in the temple courts, the chief priests, the teachers of the law and the elders came to him.
28 "By what authority are you doing these things?" they asked. "And who gave you authority to do this?"
29 Jesus replied, "I will ask you one question. Answer me, and I will tell you by what authority I am doing these things.
30 John's baptism--was it from heaven, or from men? Tell me!"
31 They discussed it among themselves and said, "If we say, 'From heaven,' he will ask, 'Then why didn't you believe him?'
32 But if we say, 'From men'...." (They feared the people, for everyone held that John really was a prophet.)
33 So they answered Jesus, "We don't know." Jesus said, "Neither will I tell you by what authority I am doing these things."

1 He then began to speak to them in parables: "A man planted a vineyard. He put a wall around it, dug a pit for the winepress and built a watchtower. Then he rented the vineyard to some farmers
and went away on a journey.
2 At harvest time he sent a servant to the tenants to collect from them some of the fruit of the vineyard.
3 But they seized him, beat him and sent him away empty-handed.
4 Then he sent another servant to them; they struck this man on the head and treated him shamefully.
5 He sent still another, and that one they killed. He sent many others; some of them they beat, others they killed.
6 "He had one left to send, a son, whom he loved. He sent him last of all, saying, 'They will respect my son.'
7 "But the tenants said to one another, 'This is the heir. Come, let's kill him, and the inheritance will be ours.'
8 So they took him and killed him, and threw him out of the vineyard.
9 "What then will the owner of the vineyard do? He will come and kill those tenants and give the vineyard to others.
10 Haven't you read this scripture: " 'The stone the builders rejected has become the capstone ;
11 the Lord has done this, and it is marvelous in our eyes' ?"
12 Then they looked for a way to arrest him because they knew he had spoken the parable against them. But they were afraid of the crowd; so they left him and went away.
13 Later they sent some of the Pharisees and Herodians to Jesus to catch him in his words.
14 They came to him and said, "Teacher, we know you are a man of integrity. You aren't swayed by men, because you pay no attention to who they are; but you teach the way of God in accordance with the truth. Is it right to pay taxes to Caesar or not?
15 Should we pay or shouldn't we?"
16 But Jesus knew their hypocrisy. "Why are you trying to trap me?" he asked.  "Bring me a denarius and let me look at it." They brought the coin, and he asked them, "Whose portrait is this? And whose inscription?" "Caesar's," they replied.
17 Then Jesus said to them, "Give to Caesar what is Caesar's and to God what is God's." And they were amazed at him.
18 Then the Sadducees, who say there is no resurrection, came to him with a question.
19 "Teacher," they said, "Moses wrote for us that if a man's brother dies and leaves a wife but no children, the man must marry the widow and have children for his brother.
20 Now there were seven brothers. The first one married and died without leaving any children.
21 The second one married the widow, but he also died, leaving no child. It was the same with the third.
22 In fact, none of the seven left any children. Last of all, the woman died too.
23 At the resurrection whose wife will she be, since the seven were married to her?"
24 Jesus replied, "Are you not in error because you do not know the Scriptures or the power of God?
25 When the dead rise, they will neither marry nor be given in marriage; they will be like the angels in heaven.
26 Now about the dead rising--have you not read in the book of Moses, in the account of the bush, how God said to him, 'I am the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob' ?
27 He is not the God of the dead, but of the living. You are badly mistaken!"
28 One of the teachers of the law came and heard them debating. Noticing that Jesus had given them a good answer, he asked him, "Of all the commandments, which is the most important?"
29 "The most important one," answered Jesus, "is this: 'Hear, O Israel, the Lord our God, the Lord is one.
30 Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind and with all your strength.'
31 The second is this: 'Love your neighbor as yourself.' There is no commandment greater than these."
32 "Well said, teacher," the man replied.  "You are right in saying that God is one and there is no other but him.
33 To love him with all your heart, with all your understanding and with all your strength, and to love your neighbor as yourself is more important than all burnt offerings and sacrifices."
34 When Jesus saw that he had answered wisely, he said to him, "You are not far from the kingdom of God." And from then on no one dared ask him any more questions.
35 While Jesus was teaching in the temple courts, he asked, "How is it that the teachers of the law say that the Christ is the son of David?
36 David himself, speaking by the Holy Spirit, declared: " 'The Lord said to my Lord: "Sit at my right hand until I put your enemies under your feet." '
37 David himself calls him 'Lord.' How then can he be his son?" The large crowd listened to him with delight.  38As he taught, Jesus said, "Watch out for the teachers of the law. They like to walk around in flowing robes and be greeted in the marketplaces,
39 and have the most important seats in the synagogues and the places of honor at banquets.
40 They devour widows' houses and for a show make lengthy prayers. Such men will be punished most severely."
41 Jesus sat down opposite the place where the offerings were put and watched the crowd putting their money into the temple treasury. Many rich people threw in large amounts.
42 But a poor widow came and put in two very small copper coins, worth only a fraction of a penny.
43 Calling his disciples to him, Jesus said, "I tell you the truth, this poor widow has put more into the treasury than all the others.
44 They all gave out of their wealth; but she, out of her poverty, put in everything--all she had to live on."

1 As he was leaving the temple, one of his disciples said to him, "Look, Teacher! What massive stones! What magnificent buildings!"
2 "Do you see all these great buildings?" replied Jesus. "Not one stone here will be left on another; every one will be thrown down."
3 As Jesus was sitting on the Mount of Olives opposite the temple, Peter, James, John and Andrew asked him privately,
4 "Tell us, when will these things happen? And what will be the sign that they are all about to be fulfilled?"
5 Jesus said to them: "Watch out that no one deceives you.
6 Many will come in my name, claiming, 'I am he,' and will deceive many.
7 When you hear of wars and rumors of wars, do not be alarmed. Such things must happen, but the end is still to come.
8 Nation will rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom. There will be earthquakes in various places, and famines. These are the beginning of birth pains.
9 "You must be on your guard. You will be handed over to the local councils and flogged in the synagogues. On account of me you will stand before governors and kings as witnesses to them.
10 And the gospel must first be preached to all nations.
11 Whenever you are arrested and brought to trial, do not worry beforehand about what to say. Just say whatever is given you at the time, for it is not you speaking, but the Holy Spirit.
12 "Brother will betray brother to death, and a father his child. Children will rebel against their parents and have them put to death.
13 All men will hate you because of me, but he who stands firm to the end will be saved.
14 "When you see 'the abomination that causes desolation' standing where it does not belong--let the reader understand--then let those who are in Judea flee to the mountains.
15 Let no one on the roof of his house go down or enter the house to take anything out.
16 Let no one in the field go back to get his cloak.
17 How dreadful it will be in those days for pregnant women and nursing mothers!
18 Pray that this will not take place in winter,
19 because those will be days of distress unequaled from the beginning, when God created the world, until now--and never to be equaled again.
20 If the Lord had not cut short those days, no one would survive. But for the sake of the elect, whom he has chosen, he has shortened them.
21 At that time if anyone says to you, 'Look, here is the Christ !' or, 'Look, there he is!' do not believe it.
22 For false Christs and false prophets will appear and perform signs and miracles to deceive the elect--if that were possible.
23 So be on your guard; I have told you everything ahead of time.
24 "But in those days, following that distress, " 'the sun will be darkened, and the moon will not give its light;
25 the stars will fall from the sky, and the heavenly bodies will be shaken.'
26 "At that time men will see the Son of Man coming in clouds with great power and glory.
27 And he will send his angels and gather his elect from the four winds, from the ends of the earth to the ends of the heavens.
28 "Now learn this lesson from the fig tree: As soon as its twigs get tender and its leaves come out, you know that summer is near.
29 Even so, when you see these things happening, you know that it is near, right at the door.
30 I tell you the truth, this generation will certainly not pass away until all these things have happened.
31 Heaven and earth will pass away, but my words will never pass away.
32 "No one knows about that day or hour, not even the angels in heaven, nor the Son, but only the Father.
33 Be on guard! Be alert ! You do not know when that time will come.
34 It's like a man going away: He leaves his house and puts his servants in charge, each with his assigned task, and tells the one at the door to keep watch.
35 "Therefore keep watch because you do not know when the owner of the house will come back--whether in the evening, or at midnight, or when the rooster crows, or at dawn.
36 If he comes suddenly, do not let him find you sleeping.
37 What I say to you, I say to everyone: 'Watch!' "

1 Now the Passover and the Feast of Unleavened Bread were only two days away, and the chief priests and the teachers of the law were looking for some sly way to arrest Jesus and kill him.
2 "But not during the Feast," they said, "or the people may riot."
3 While he was in Bethany, reclining at the table in the home of a man known as Simon the Leper, a woman came with an alabaster jar of very expensive perfume, made of pure nard. She broke the jar and poured the perfume on his head.
4 Some of those present were saying indignantly to one another, "Why this waste of perfume?
5 It could have been sold for more than a year's wages and the money given to the poor." And they rebuked her harshly.
6 "Leave her alone," said Jesus. "Why are you bothering her? She has done a beautiful thing to me.
7 The poor you will always have with you, and you can help them any time you want. But you will not always have me.
8 She did what she could. She poured perfume on my body beforehand to prepare for my burial.
9 I tell you the truth, wherever the gospel is preached throughout the world, what she has done will also be told, in memory of her."
10 Then Judas Iscariot, one of the Twelve, went to the chief priests to betray Jesus to them.
11 They were delighted to hear this and promised to give him money. So he watched for an opportunity to hand him over.
12 On the first day of the Feast of Unleavened Bread, when it was customary to sacrifice the Passover lamb, Jesus' disciples asked him, "Where do you want us to go and make preparations for you to eat the Passover?"
13 So he sent two of his disciples, telling them, "Go into the city, and a man carrying a jar of water will meet you.  Follow him.
14 Say to the owner of the house he enters, 'The Teacher asks: Where is my guest room, where I may eat the Passover with my disciples?'
15 He will show you a large upper room, furnished and ready. Make preparations for us there."
16 The disciples left, went into the city and found things just as Jesus had told them. So they prepared the Passover.
17 When evening came, Jesus arrived with the Twelve.
18 While they were reclining at the table eating, he said, "I tell you the truth, one of you will betray me--one who is eating with me."
19 They were saddened, and one by one they said to him, "Surely not I?"
20 "It is one of the Twelve," he replied, "one who dips bread into the bowl with me.
21 The Son of Man will go just as it is written about him. But woe to that man who betrays the Son of Man! It would be better for him if he had not been born."
22 While they were eating, Jesus took bread, gave thanks and broke it, and gave it to his disciples, saying, "Take it; this is my body."
23 Then he took the cup, gave thanks and offered it to them, and they all drank from it.
24 "This is my blood of the covenant, which is poured out for many," he said to them.
25 "I tell you the truth, I will not drink again of the fruit of the vine until that day when I drink it anew in the kingdom of God."
26 When they had sung a hymn, they went out to the Mount of Olives.
27 "You will all fall away," Jesus told them, "for it is written: " 'I will strike the shepherd, and the sheep will be scattered.'
28 But after I have risen, I will go ahead of you into Galilee."
29 Peter declared, "Even if all fall away, I will not."
30 "I tell you the truth," Jesus answered, "today--yes, tonight--before the rooster crows twice you yourself will disown me three times."
31 But Peter insisted emphatically, "Even if I have to die with you, I will never disown you." And all the others said the same.
32 They went to a place called Gethsemane, and Jesus said to his disciples, "Sit here while I pray."
33 He took Peter, James and John along with him, and he began to be deeply distressed and troubled.
34 "My soul is overwhelmed with sorrow to the point of death," he said to them.  "Stay here and keep watch."
35 Going a little farther, he fell to the ground and prayed that if possible the hour might pass from him.
36 "Abba, Father," he said, "everything is possible for you. Take this cup from me.  Yet not what I will, but what you will."
37 Then he returned to his disciples and found them sleeping. "Simon," he said to Peter, "are you asleep? Could you not keep watch for one hour?
38 Watch and pray so that you will not fall into temptation. The spirit is willing, but the body is weak."
39 Once more he went away and prayed the same thing.
40 When he came back, he again found them sleeping, because their eyes were heavy. They did not know what to say to him.
41 Returning the third time, he said to them, "Are you still sleeping and resting? Enough! The hour has come.  Look, the Son of Man is betrayed into the hands of sinners.
42 Rise! Let us go! Here comes my betrayer!"
43 Just as he was speaking, Judas, one of the Twelve, appeared. With him was a crowd armed with swords and clubs, sent from the chief priests, the teachers of the law, and the elders.
44 Now the betrayer had arranged a signal with them: "The one I kiss is the man; arrest him and lead him away under guard."
45 Going at once to Jesus, Judas said, "Rabbi!" and kissed him.
46 The men seized Jesus and arrested him.
47 Then one of those standing near drew his sword and struck the servant of the high priest, cutting off his ear.
48 "Am I leading a rebellion," said Jesus, "that you have come out with swords and clubs to capture me?
49 Every day I was with you, teaching in the temple courts, and you did not arrest me. But the Scriptures must be fulfilled."
50 Then everyone deserted him and fled.
51 A young man, wearing nothing but a linen garment, was following Jesus.  When they seized him,
52 he fled naked, leaving his garment behind.
53 They took Jesus to the high priest, and all the chief priests, elders and teachers of the law came together.
54 Peter followed him at a distance, right into the courtyard of the high priest.  There he sat with the guards and warmed himself at the fire.
55 The chief priests and the whole Sanhedrin were looking for evidence against Jesus so that they could put him to death, but they did not find any.
56 Many testified falsely against him, but their statements did not agree.
57 Then some stood up and gave this false testimony against him:
58 "We heard him say, 'I will destroy this man-made temple and in three days will build another, not made by man.' "
59 Yet even then their testimony did not agree.
60 Then the high priest stood up before them and asked Jesus, "Are you not going to answer? What is this testimony that these men are bringing against you?"
61 But Jesus remained silent and gave no answer. Again the high priest asked him, "Are you the Christ, the Son of the Blessed One?"
62 "I am," said Jesus. "And you will see the Son of Man sitting at the right hand of the Mighty One and coming on the clouds of heaven."
63 The high priest tore his clothes. "Why do we need any more witnesses?" he asked.
64 "You have heard the blasphemy. What do you think?"
65 They all condemned him as worthy of death. Then some began to spit at him; they blindfolded him, struck him with their fists, and said, "Prophesy!" And the guards took him and beat him.
66 While Peter was below in the courtyard, one of the servant girls of the high priest came by.
67 When she saw Peter warming himself, she looked closely at him. "You also were with that Nazarene, Jesus," she said.
68 But he denied it. "I don't know or understand what you're talking about," he said, and went out into the entryway.
69 When the servant girl saw him there, she said again to those standing around, "This fellow is one of them."
70 Again he denied it. After a little while, those standing near said to Peter, "Surely you are one of them, for you are a Galilean."
71 He began to call down curses on himself, and he swore to them, "I don't know this man you're talking about."
72 Immediately the rooster crowed the second time. Then Peter remembered the word Jesus had spoken to him: "Before the rooster crows twice you will disown me three times." And he broke down and wept.

1 Very early in the morning, the chief priests, with the elders, the teachers of the law and the whole Sanhedrin, reached a decision. They bound Jesus, led him away and handed him over to Pilate.
2 "Are you the king of the Jews?" asked Pilate. "Yes, it is as you say," Jesus replied.
3 The chief priests accused him of many things.
4 So again Pilate asked him, "Aren't you going to answer? See how many things they are accusing you of."
5 But Jesus still made no reply, and Pilate was amazed.
6 Now it was the custom at the Feast to release a prisoner whom the people requested.
7 A man called Barabbas was in prison with the insurrectionists who had committed murder in the uprising.
8 The crowd came up and asked Pilate to do for them what he usually did.
9 "Do you want me to release to you the king of the Jews?" asked Pilate,
10 knowing it was out of envy that the chief priests had handed Jesus over to him.
11 But the chief priests stirred up the crowd to have Pilate release Barabbas instead.
12 "What shall I do, then, with the one you call the king of the Jews?" Pilate asked them.
13 "Crucify him!" they shouted.
14 "Why? What crime has he committed?" asked Pilate. But they shouted all the louder, "Crucify him!"
15 Wanting to satisfy the crowd, Pilate released Barabbas to them. He had Jesus flogged, and handed him over to be crucified.
16 The soldiers led Jesus away into the palace (that is, the Praetorium) and called together the whole company of soldiers.
17 They put a purple robe on him, then twisted together a crown of thorns and set it on him.
18 And they began to call out to him, "Hail, king of the Jews!"
19 Again and again they struck him on the head with a staff and spit on him.  Falling on their knees, they paid homage to him.
20 And when they had mocked him, they took off the purple robe and put his own clothes on him. Then they led him out to crucify him.
21 A certain man from Cyrene, Simon, the father of Alexander and Rufus, was passing by on his way in from the country, and they forced him to carry the cross.
22 They brought Jesus to the place called Golgotha (which means The Place of the Skull).
23 Then they offered him wine mixed with myrrh, but he did not take it.
24 And they crucified him. Dividing up his clothes, they cast lots to see what each would get.
25 It was the third hour when they crucified him.
26 The written notice of the charge against him read: THE KING OF THE JEWS.
27 They crucified two robbers with him, one on his right and one on his left.
29 Those who passed by hurled insults at him, shaking their heads and saying, "So! You who are going to destroy the temple and build it in three days,
30 come down from the cross and save yourself!"
31 In the same way the chief priests and the teachers of the law mocked him among themselves. "He saved others," they said, "but he can't save himself!
32 Let this Christ, this King of Israel, come down now from the cross, that we may see and believe." Those crucified with him also heaped insults on him.
33 At the sixth hour darkness came over the whole land until the ninth hour.
34 And at the ninth hour Jesus cried out in a loud voice, "Eloi, Eloi, lama sabachthani?"--which means, "My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?"
35 When some of those standing near heard this, they said, "Listen, he's calling Elijah."
36 One man ran, filled a sponge with wine vinegar, put it on a stick, and offered it to Jesus to drink. "Now leave him alone.  Let's see if Elijah comes to take him down," he said.
37 With a loud cry, Jesus breathed his last.
38 The curtain of the temple was torn in two from top to bottom.
39 And when the centurion, who stood there in front of Jesus, heard his cry and saw how he died, he said, "Surely this man was the Son of God!"
40 Some women were watching from a distance. Among them were Mary Magdalene, Mary the mother of James the younger and of Joses, and Salome.
41 In Galilee these women had followed him and cared for his needs. Many other women who had come up with him to Jerusalem were also there.
42 It was Preparation Day (that is, the day before the Sabbath). So as evening approached,
43 Joseph of Arimathea, a prominent member of the Council, who was himself waiting for the kingdom of God, went boldly to Pilate and asked for Jesus' body.
44 Pilate was surprised to hear that he was already dead. Summoning the centurion, he asked him if Jesus had already died.
45 When he learned from the centurion that it was so, he gave the body to Joseph.
46 So Joseph bought some linen cloth, took down the body, wrapped it in the linen, and placed it in a tomb cut out of rock. Then he rolled a stone against the entrance of the tomb.
47 Mary Magdalene and Mary the mother of Joses saw where he was laid.

1 When the Sabbath was over, Mary Magdalene, Mary the mother of James, and Salome bought spices so that they might go to anoint Jesus' body.
2 Very early on the first day of the week, just after sunrise, they were on their way to the tomb
3 and they asked each other, "Who will roll the stone away from the entrance of the tomb?"
4 But when they looked up, they saw that the stone, which was very large, had been rolled away.
5 As they entered the tomb, they saw a young man dressed in a white robe sitting on the right side, and they were alarmed.
6 "Don't be alarmed," he said. "You are looking for Jesus the Nazarene, who was crucified. He has risen! He is not here. See the place where they laid him.
7 But go, tell his disciples and Peter, 'He is going ahead of you into Galilee. There you will see him, just as he told you.' "
8 Trembling and bewildered, the women went out and fled from the tomb. They said nothing to anyone, because they were afraid.
9 When Jesus rose early on the first day of the week, he appeared first to Mary Magdalene, out of whom he had driven seven demons.
10 She went and told those who had been with him and who were mourning and weeping.
11 When they heard that Jesus was alive and that she had seen him, they did not believe it.
12 Afterward Jesus appeared in a different form to two of them while they were walking in the country.
13 These returned and reported it to the rest; but they did not believe them either.
14 Later Jesus appeared to the Eleven as they were eating; he rebuked them for their lack of faith and their stubborn refusal to believe those who had seen him after he had risen.
15 He said to them, "Go into all the world and preach the good news to all creation.
16 Whoever believes and is baptized will be saved, but whoever does not believe will be condemned.
17 And these signs will accompany those who believe: In my name they will drive out demons; they will speak in new tongues;
18 they will pick up snakes with their hands; and when they drink deadly poison, it will not hurt them at all; they will place their hands on sick people, and they will get well."
19 After the Lord Jesus had spoken to them, he was taken up into heaven and he sat at the right hand of God.
20 Then the disciples went out and preached everywhere, and the Lord worked with them and confirmed his word by the signs that accompanied it.

1 Many have undertaken to draw up an account of the things that have been fulfilled among us,
2 just as they were handed down to us by those who from the first were eyewitnesses and servants of the word.
3 Therefore, since I myself have carefully investigated everything from the beginning, it seemed good also to me to write an orderly account for you, most excellent Theophilus,
4 so that you may know the certainty of the things you have been taught.
5 In the time of Herod king of Judea there was a priest named Zechariah, who belonged to the priestly division of Abijah; his wife Elizabeth was also a descendant of Aaron.
6 Both of them were upright in the sight of God, observing all the Lord's commandments and regulations blamelessly.
7 But they had no children, because Elizabeth was barren; and they were both well along in years.
8 Once when Zechariah's division was on duty and he was serving as priest before God,
9 he was chosen by lot, according to the custom of the priesthood, to go into the temple of the Lord and burn incense.
10 And when the time for the burning of incense came, all the assembled worshipers were praying outside.
11 Then an angel of the Lord appeared to him, standing at the right side of the altar of incense.
12 When Zechariah saw him, he was startled and was gripped with fear.
13 But the angel said to him: "Do not be afraid, Zechariah; your prayer has been heard. Your wife Elizabeth will bear you a son, and you are to give him the name John.
14 He will be a joy and delight to you, and many will rejoice because of his birth,
15 for he will be great in the sight of the Lord. He is never to take wine or other fermented drink, and he will be filled with the Holy Spirit even from birth.
16 Many of the people of Israel will he bring back to the Lord their God.
17 And he will go on before the Lord, in the spirit and power of Elijah, to turn the hearts of the fathers to their children and the disobedient to the wisdom of the righteous--to make ready a people prepared for the Lord."
18 Zechariah asked the angel, "How can I be sure of this? I am an old man and my wife is well along in years."
19 The angel answered, "I am Gabriel. I stand in the presence of God, and I have been sent to speak to you and to tell you this good news.
20 And now you will be silent and not able to speak until the day this happens, because you did not believe my words, which will come true at their proper time."
21 Meanwhile, the people were waiting for Zechariah and wondering why he stayed so long in the temple.
22 When he came out, he could not speak to them. They realized he had seen a vision in the temple, for he kept making signs to them but remained unable to speak.
23 When his time of service was completed, he returned home.
24 After this his wife Elizabeth became pregnant and for five months remained in seclusion.
25 "The Lord has done this for me," she said. "In these days he has shown his favor and taken away my disgrace among the people."
26 In the sixth month, God sent the angel Gabriel to Nazareth, a town in Galilee,
27 to a virgin pledged to be married to a man named Joseph, a descendant of David. The virgin's name was Mary.
28 The angel went to her and said, "Greetings, you who are highly favored!  The Lord is with you."
29 Mary was greatly troubled at his words and wondered what kind of greeting this might be.
30 But the angel said to her, "Do not be afraid, Mary, you have found favor with God.
31 You will be with child and give birth to a son, and you are to give him the name Jesus.
32 He will be great and will be called the Son of the Most High. The Lord God will give him the throne of his father David,
33 and he will reign over the house of Jacob forever; his kingdom will never end."
34 "How will this be," Mary asked the angel, "since I am a virgin?"
35 The angel answered, "The Holy Spirit will come upon you, and the power of the Most High will overshadow you. So the holy one to be born will be called the Son of God.
36 Even Elizabeth your relative is going to have a child in her old age, and she who was said to be barren is in her sixth month.
37 For nothing is impossible with God."
38 "I am the Lord's servant," Mary answered. "May it be to me as you have said." Then the angel left her.
39 At that time Mary got ready and hurried to a town in the hill country of Judea,
40 where she entered Zechariah's home and greeted Elizabeth.
41 When Elizabeth heard Mary's greeting, the baby leaped in her womb, and Elizabeth was filled with the Holy Spirit.
42 In a loud voice she exclaimed: "Blessed are you among women, and blessed is the child you will bear!
43 But why am I so favored, that the mother of my Lord should come to me?
44 As soon as the sound of your greeting reached my ears, the baby in my womb leaped for joy.
45 Blessed is she who has believed that what the Lord has said to her will be accomplished!"
46 And Mary said: "My soul glorifies the Lord
47 and my spirit rejoices in God my Savior,
48 for he has been mindful of the humble state of his servant. From now on all generations will call me blessed,
49 for the Mighty One has done great things for me-- holy is his name.
50 His mercy extends to those who fear him, from generation to generation.
51 He has performed mighty deeds with his arm; he has scattered those who are proud in their inmost thoughts.
52 He has brought down rulers from their thrones but has lifted up the humble.
53 He has filled the hungry with good things but has sent the rich away empty.
54 He has helped his servant Israel, remembering to be merciful
55 to Abraham and his descendants forever, even as he said to our fathers."
56 Mary stayed with Elizabeth for about three months and then returned home.
57 When it was time for Elizabeth to have her baby, she gave birth to a son.
58 Her neighbors and relatives heard that the Lord had shown her great mercy, and they shared her joy.
59 On the eighth day they came to circumcise the child, and they were going to name him after his father Zechariah,
60 but his mother spoke up and said, "No!  He is to be called John."
61 They said to her, "There is no one among your relatives who has that name."
62 Then they made signs to his father, to find out what he would like to name the child.
63 He asked for a writing tablet, and to everyone's astonishment he wrote, "His name is John."
64 Immediately his mouth was opened and his tongue was loosed, and he began to speak, praising God.
65 The neighbors were all filled with awe, and throughout the hill country of Judea people were talking about all these things.
66 Everyone who heard this wondered about it, asking, "What then is this child going to be?" For the Lord's hand was with him.
67 His father Zechariah was filled with the Holy Spirit and prophesied:
68 "Praise be to the Lord, the God of Israel, because he has come and has redeemed his people.
69 He has raised up a horn of salvation for us in the house of his servant David
70 (as he said through his holy prophets of long ago),
71 salvation from our enemies and from the hand of all who hate us--
72 to show mercy to our fathers and to remember his holy covenant,
73 the oath he swore to our father Abraham:
74 to rescue us from the hand of our enemies, and to enable us to serve him without fear
75 in holiness and righteousness before him all our days.
76 And you, my child, will be called a prophet of the Most High; for you will go on before the Lord to prepare the way for him,
77 to give his people the knowledge of salvation through the forgiveness of their sins,
78 because of the tender mercy of our God, by which the rising sun will come to us from heaven
79 to shine on those living in darkness and in the shadow of death, to guide our feet into the path of peace."
80 And the child grew and became strong in spirit; and he lived in the desert until he appeared publicly to Israel.

1 In those days Caesar Augustus issued a decree that a census should be taken of the entire Roman world.
2(This was the first census that took place while Quirinius was governor of Syria.)
3And everyone went to his own town to register.
4So Joseph also went up from the town of Nazareth in Galilee to Judea, to Bethlehem the town of David, because he belonged to the house and line of David.
5He went there to register with Mary, who was pledged to be married to him and was expecting a child.
6While they were there, the time came for the baby to be born,
7and she gave birth to her firstborn, a son. She wrapped him in cloths and placed him in a manger, because there was no room for them in the inn.
8And there were shepherds living out in the fields nearby, keeping watch over their flocks at night.
9An angel of the Lord appeared to them, and the glory of the Lord shone around them, and they were terrified.
10But the angel said to them, "Do not be afraid. I bring you good news of great joy that will be for all the people.
11Today in the town of David a Savior has been born to you; he is Christ the Lord.
12This will be a sign to you: You will find a baby wrapped in cloths and lying in a manger."
13Suddenly a great company of the heavenly host appeared with the angel, praising God and saying,
14"Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace to men on whom his favor rests."
15When the angels had left them and gone into heaven, the shepherds said to one another, "Let's go to Bethlehem and see this thing that has happened, which the Lord has told us about."
16So they hurried off and found Mary
and Joseph, and the baby, who was
lying in the manger.
17When they had seen him, they spread
the word concerning what had been told
them about this child,
18and all who heard it were amazed at
what the shepherds said to them.
19But Mary treasured up all these things
and pondered them in her heart.
20The shepherds returned, glorifying and
praising God for all the things they had
heard and seen, which were just as they
had been told.
21On the eighth day, when it was time to
circumcise him, he was named Jesus,
the name the angel had given him
before he had been conceived.
22When the time of their purification
according to the Law of Moses had
been completed, Joseph and Mary took
him to Jerusalem to present him to the
Lord
23(as it is written in the Law of the Lord,
"Every firstborn male is to be
consecrated to the Lord" ),
24and to offer a sacrifice in keeping with
what is said in the Law of the Lord: "a
pair of doves or two young pigeons."
25Now there was a man in Jerusalem
called Simeon, who was righteous and
devout. He was waiting for the
consolation of Israel, and the Holy Spirit
was upon him.
26It had been revealed to him by the
Holy Spirit that he would not die before
he had seen the Lord's Christ.
27Moved by the Spirit, he went into the
temple courts. When the parents
brought in the child Jesus to do for him
what the custom of the Law required,
28Simeon took him in his arms and
praised God, saying:
29"Sovereign Lord, as you have
promised, you now dismiss your servant
in peace.
30For my eyes have seen your salvation,
31which you have prepared in the sight
of all people,
32a light for revelation to the Gentiles
and for glory to your people Israel."
33The child's father and mother
marveled at what was said about him.
34Then Simeon blessed them and said
to Mary, his mother: "This child is
destined to cause the falling and rising
of many in Israel, and to be a sign that
will be spoken against,
35so that the thoughts of many hearts
will be revealed. And a sword will pierce
your own soul too."
36There was also a prophetess, Anna,
the daughter of Phanuel, of the tribe of
Asher. She was very old; she had lived
with her husband seven years after her
marriage,
37and then was a widow until she was
eighty-four. She never left the temple
but worshiped night and day, fasting and
praying.
38Coming up to them at that very
moment, she gave thanks to God and
spoke about the child to all who were
looking forward to the redemption of
Jerusalem.
39When Joseph and Mary had done
everything required by the Law of the
Lord, they returned to Galilee to their
own town of Nazareth.
40And the child grew and became
strong; he was filled with wisdom, and
the grace of God was upon him.
41Every year his parents went to
Jerusalem for the Feast of the Passover.
42When he was twelve years old, they
went up to the Feast, according to the
custom.
43After the Feast was over, while his
parents were returning home, the boy
Jesus stayed behind in Jerusalem, but
they were unaware of it.
44Thinking he was in their company,
they traveled on for a day. Then they
began looking for him among their
relatives and friends.
45When they did not find him, they went
back to Jerusalem to look for him.
46After three days they found him in the
temple courts, sitting among the
teachers, listening to them and asking
them questions.
47Everyone who heard him was amazed
at his understanding and his answers.
48When his parents saw him, they were
astonished. His mother said to him,
"Son, why have you treated us like this?
Your father and I have been anxiously
searching for you."
49"Why were you searching for me?" he
asked. "Didn't you know I had to be in
my Father's house?"
50But they did not understand what he
was saying to them.
51Then he went down to Nazareth with
them and was obedient to them. But his
mother treasured all these things in her
heart.
52And Jesus grew in wisdom and stature,
and in favor with God and men.

1In the fifteenth year of the reign of
Tiberius Caesar--when Pontius Pilate
was governor of Judea, Herod tetrarch
of Galilee, his brother Philip tetrarch of
Iturea and Traconitis, and Lysanias
tetrarch of Abilene--
2during the high priesthood of Annas
and Caiaphas, the word of God came to
John son of Zechariah in the desert.
3He went into all the country around the
Jordan, preaching a baptism of
repentance for the forgiveness of sins.
4As is written in the book of the words of
Isaiah the prophet: "A voice of one
calling in the desert, 'Prepare the way
for the Lord, make straight paths for him.
5Every valley shall be filled in, every
mountain and hill made low. The
crooked roads shall become straight,
the rough ways smooth.
6And all mankind will see God's
salvation.' "
7John said to the crowds coming out to
be baptized by him, "You brood of
vipers! Who warned you to flee from the
coming wrath?
8Produce fruit in keeping with
repentance. And do not begin to say to
yourselves, 'We have Abraham as our
father.' For I tell you that out of these
stones God can raise up children for
Abraham.
9The ax is already at the root of the
trees, and every tree that does not
produce good fruit will be cut down and
thrown into the fire."
10"What should we do then?" the crowd
asked.
11John answered, "The man with two
tunics should share with him who has
none, and the one who has food should
do the same."
12Tax collectors also came to be
baptized. "Teacher," they asked, "what
should we do?"
13"Don't collect any more than you are
required to," he told
14them. Then some soldiers asked him,
"And what should we do?" He replied,
"Don't extort money and don't accuse
people falsely--be content with your
pay."
15The people were waiting expectantly
and were all wondering in their hearts if
John might possibly be the Christ.
16John answered them all, "I baptize you
with water. But one more powerful than I
will come, the thongs of whose sandals I
am not worthy to untie. He will baptize
you with the Holy Spirit and with fire.
17His winnowing fork is in his hand to
clear his threshing floor and to gather
the wheat into his barn, but he will burn
up the chaff with unquenchable fire."
18And with many other words John
exhorted the people and preached the
good news to them.
19But when John rebuked Herod the
tetrarch because of Herodias, his
brother's wife, and all the other evil
things he had done,
20Herod added this to them all: He
locked John up in prison.
21When all the people were being
baptized, Jesus was baptized too. And
as he was praying, heaven was opened
22and the Holy Spirit descended on him
in bodily form like a dove. And a voice
came from heaven: "You are my Son,
whom I love; with you I am well
pleased."

---lk4.1-4.44 { (ch4)
1Jesus, full of the Holy Spirit, returned
from the Jordan and was led by the
Spirit in the desert,
2where for forty days he was tempted by
the devil. He ate nothing during those
days, and at the end of them he was
hungry.
3The devil said to him, "If you are the
Son of God, tell this stone to become
bread."
4Jesus answered, "It is written: 'Man
does not live on bread alone.' "
5The devil led him up to a high place
and showed him in an instant all the
kingdoms of the world.
6And he said to him, "I will give you all
their authority and splendor, for it has
been given to me, and I can give it to
anyone I want to.
7So if you worship me, it will all be
yours."
8Jesus answered, "It is written: 'Worship
the Lord your God and serve him only.' "
9The devil led him to Jerusalem and had
him stand on the highest point of the
temple. "If you are the Son of God," he
said, "throw yourself down from here.
10For it is written: " 'He will command his
angels concerning you to guard you
carefully;
11they will lift you up in their hands, so
that you will not strike your foot against
a stone.' "
12Jesus answered, "It says: 'Do not put
the Lord your God to the test.' "
13When the devil had finished all this
tempting, he left him until an opportune
time.
14Jesus returned to Galilee in the power
of the Spirit, and news about him spread
through the whole countryside.
15He taught in their synagogues, and
everyone praised him.
16He went to Nazareth, where he had
been brought up, and on the Sabbath
day he went into the synagogue, as was
his custom. And he stood up to read.
17The scroll of the prophet Isaiah was
handed to him. Unrolling it, he found the
place where it is written:
18"The Spirit of the Lord is on me,
because he has anointed me to preach
good news to the poor. He has sent me
to proclaim freedom for the prisoners
and recovery of sight for the blind, to
release the oppressed,
19to proclaim the year of the Lord's
favor."
20Then he rolled up the scroll, gave it
back to the attendant and sat down. The
eyes of everyone in the synagogue were
fastened on him,
21and he began by saying to them,
"Today this scripture is fulfilled in your
hearing."
22All spoke well of him and were
amazed at the gracious words that
came from his lips. "Isn't this Joseph's
son?" they asked.
23Jesus said to them, "Surely you will
quote this proverb to me: 'Physician,
heal yourself! Do here in your hometown
what we have heard that you did in
Capernaum.' "
24"I tell you the truth," he continued, "no
prophet is accepted in his hometown.
25I assure you that there were many
widows in Israel in Elijah's time, when
the sky was shut for three and a half
years and there was a severe famine
throughout the land.
26Yet Elijah was not sent to any of them,
but to a widow in Zarephath in the
region of Sidon.
27And there were many in Israel with
leprosy in the time of Elisha the prophet,
yet not one of them was cleansed--only
Naaman the Syrian."
28All the people in the synagogue were
furious when they heard this.
29They got up, drove him out of the town,
and took him to the brow of the hill on
which the town was built, in order to
throw him down the cliff.
30But he walked right through the crowd
and went on his way.
31Then he went down to Capernaum, a
town in Galilee, and on the Sabbath
began to teach the people.
32They were amazed at his teaching,
because his message had authority.
33In the synagogue there was a man
possessed by a demon, an evil spirit. He
cried out at the top of his voice,
34"Ha! What do you want with us, Jesus
of Nazareth? Have you come to destroy
us? I know who you are--the Holy One
of God!"
35"Be quiet!" Jesus said sternly. "Come
out of him!" Then the demon threw the
man down before them all and came out
without injuring him.
36All the people were amazed and said
to each other, "What is this teaching?
With authority and power he gives
orders to evil spirits and they come out!"
37And the news about him spread
throughout the surrounding area.
38Jesus left the synagogue and went to
the home of Simon. Now Simon's
mother-in-law was suffering from a high
fever, and they asked Jesus to help her.
39So he bent over her and rebuked the
fever, and it left her. She got up at once
and began to wait on them.
40When the sun was setting, the people
brought to Jesus all who had various
kinds of sickness, and laying his hands
on each one, he healed them.
41Moreover, demons came out of many
people, shouting, "You are the Son of
God!" But he rebuked them and would
not allow them to speak, because they
knew he was the Christ.
42At daybreak Jesus went out to a
solitary place. The people were looking
for him and when they came to where
he was, they tried to keep him from
leaving them.
43But he said, "I must preach the good
news of the kingdom of God to the other
towns also, because that is why I was
sent."
44And he kept on preaching in the
synagogues of Judea.

1One day as Jesus was standing by
the Lake of Gennesaret, with the people
crowding around him and listening to the
word of God,
2he saw at the water's edge two boats,
left there by the fishermen, who were
washing their nets.
3He got into one of the boats, the one
belonging to Simon, and asked him to
put out a little from shore. Then he sat
down and taught the people from the
boat.
4When he had finished speaking, he
said to Simon, "Put out into deep water,
and let down the nets for a catch."
5Simon answered, "Master, we've
worked hard all night and haven't caught
anything. But because you say so, I will
let down the nets."
6When they had done so, they caught
such a large number of fish that their
nets began to break.
7So they signaled their partners in the
other boat to come and help them, and
they came and filled both boats so full
that they began to sink.
8When Simon Peter saw this, he fell at
Jesus' knees and said, "Go away from
me, Lord; I am a sinful man!"
9For he and all his companions were
astonished at the catch of fish they had
taken,
10and so were James and John, the
sons of Zebedee, Simon's partners.
11Then Jesus said to Simon, "Don't be
afraid; from now on you will catch men."
So they pulled their boats up on shore,
left everything and followed him.
12While Jesus was in one of the towns, a
man came along who was covered with
leprosy. When he saw Jesus, he fell
with his face to the ground and begged
him, "Lord, if you are willing, you can
make me clean."
13Jesus reached out his hand and
touched the man. "I am willing," he said.
"Be clean!" And immediately the leprosy
left him.
14Then Jesus ordered him, "Don't tell
anyone, but go, show yourself to the
priest and offer the sacrifices that Moses
commanded for your cleansing, as a
testimony to them."
15Yet the news about him spread all the
more, so that crowds of people came to
hear him and to be healed of their
sicknesses.
16But Jesus often withdrew to lonely
places and prayed.
17One day as he was teaching,
Pharisees and teachers of the law, who
had come from every village of Galilee
and from Judea and Jerusalem, were
sitting there. And the power of the Lord
was present for him to heal the sick.
18Some men came carrying a paralytic
on a mat and tried to take him into the
house to lay him before Jesus.
19When they could not find a way to do
this because of the crowd, they went up
on the roof and lowered him on his mat
through the tiles into the middle of the
crowd, right in front of Jesus.
20When Jesus saw their faith, he said,
"Friend, your sins are forgiven."
21The Pharisees and the teachers of the
law began thinking to themselves, "Who
is this fellow who speaks blasphemy?
Who can forgive sins but God alone?"
22Jesus knew what they were thinking
and asked, "Why are you thinking these
things in your hearts?
23Which is easier: to say, 'Your sins are
forgiven,' or to say, 'Get up and walk'?
24But that you may know that the Son of
Man has authority on earth to forgive
sins...." He said to the paralyzed man, "I
tell you, get up, take your mat and go
home."
25Immediately he stood up in front of
them, took what he had been lying on
and went home praising God.
26Everyone was amazed and gave
praise to God. They were filled with awe
and said, "We have seen remarkable
things today."
27After this, Jesus went out and saw a
tax collector by the name of Levi sitting
at his tax booth. "Follow me," Jesus said
to him,
28and Levi got up, left everything and
followed him.
29Then Levi held a great banquet for
Jesus at his house, and a large crowd of
tax collectors and others were eating
with them.
30But the Pharisees and the teachers of
the law who belonged to their sect
complained to his disciples, "Why do
you eat and drink with tax collectors and
'sinners'?"
31Jesus answered them, "It is not the
healthy who need a doctor, but the sick.
32I have not come to call the righteous,
but sinners to repentance."
33They said to him, "John's disciples
often fast and pray, and so do the
disciples of the Pharisees, but yours go
on eating and drinking."
34Jesus answered, "Can you make the
guests of the bridegroom fast while he is
with them?
35But the time will come when the
bridegroom will be taken from them; in
those days they will fast."
36He told them this parable: "No one
tears a patch from a new garment and
sews it on an old one. If he does, he will
have torn the new garment, and the
patch from the new will not match the
old.
37And no one pours new wine into old
wineskins. If he does, the new wine will
burst the skins, the wine will run out and
the wineskins will be ruined.
38No, new wine must be poured into new
wineskins.
39And no one after drinking old wine
wants the new, for he says, 'The old is
better.' "

1One Sabbath Jesus was going
through the grainfields, and his disciples
began to pick some heads of grain, rub
them in their hands and eat the kernels.
2Some of the Pharisees asked, "Why
are you doing what is unlawful on the
Sabbath?"
3Jesus answered them, "Have you
never read what David did when he and
his companions were hungry?
4He entered the house of God, and
taking the consecrated bread, he ate
what is lawful only for priests to eat. And
he also gave some to his companions."
5Then Jesus said to them, "The Son of
Man is Lord of the Sabbath."
6On another Sabbath he went into the
synagogue and was teaching, and a
man was there whose right hand was
shriveled.
7The Pharisees and the teachers of the
law were looking for a reason to accuse
Jesus, so they watched him closely to
see if he would heal on the Sabbath.
8But Jesus knew what they were
thinking and said to the man with the
shriveled hand, "Get up and stand in
front of everyone." So he got up and
stood there.
9Then Jesus said to them, "I ask you,
which is lawful on the Sabbath: to do
good or to do evil, to save life or to
destroy it?"
10He looked around at them all, and then
said to the man, "Stretch out your hand."
He did so, and his hand was completely
restored.
11But they were furious and began to
discuss with one another what they
might do to Jesus.
12One of those days Jesus went out to a
mountainside to pray, and spent the
night praying to God.
13When morning came, he called his
disciples to him and chose twelve of
them, whom he also designated
apostles:
14Simon (whom he named Peter), his
brother Andrew, James, John, Philip,
Bartholomew,
15Matthew, Thomas, James son of
Alphaeus, Simon who was called the
Zealot,
16Judas son of James, and Judas
Iscariot, who became a traitor.
17He went down with them and stood on
a level place. A large crowd of his
disciples was there and a great number
of people from all over Judea, from
Jerusalem, and from the coast of Tyre
and Sidon,
18who had come to hear him and to be
healed of their diseases. Those troubled
by evil spirits were cured,
19and the people all tried to touch him,
because power was coming from him
and healing them all.
20Looking at his disciples, he said:
"Blessed are you who are poor, for
yours is the kingdom of God.
21Blessed are you who hunger now, for
you will be satisfied. Blessed are you
who weep now, for you will laugh.
22Blessed are you when men hate you,
when they exclude you and insult you
and reject your name as evil, because of
the Son of Man.
23"Rejoice in that day and leap for joy,
because great is your reward in heaven.
For that is how their fathers treated the
prophets.
24"But woe to you who are rich, for you
have already received your comfort.
25Woe to you who are well fed now, for
you will go hungry. Woe to you who
laugh now, for you will mourn and weep.
26Woe to you when all men speak well
of you, for that is how their fathers
treated the false prophets.
27"But I tell you who hear me: Love your
enemies, do good to those who hate
you,
28bless those who curse you, pray for
those who mistreat you.
29If someone strikes you on one cheek,
turn to him the other also. If someone
takes your cloak, do not stop him from
taking your tunic.
30Give to everyone who asks you, and if
anyone takes what belongs to you, do
not demand it back.
31Do to others as you would have them
do to you.
32"If you love those who love you, what
credit is that to you? Even 'sinners' love
those who love them.
33And if you do good to those who are
good to you, what credit is that to you?
Even 'sinners' do that.
34And if you lend to those from whom
you expect repayment, what credit is
that to you? Even 'sinners' lend to
'sinners,' expecting to be repaid in full.
35But love your enemies, do good to
them, and lend to them without
expecting to get anything back. Then
your reward will be great, and you will
be sons of the Most High, because he is
kind to the ungrateful and wicked.
36Be merciful, just as your Father is
merciful.
37"Do not judge, and you will not be
judged. Do not condemn, and you will
not be condemned. Forgive, and you will
be forgiven.
38Give, and it will be given to you. A
good measure, pressed down, shaken
together and running over, will be
poured into your lap. For with the
measure you use, it will be measured to
you."
39He also told them this parable: "Can a
blind man lead a blind man? Will they
not both fall into a pit?
40A student is not above his teacher, but
everyone who is fully trained will be like
his teacher.
41"Why do you look at the speck of
sawdust in your brother's eye and pay
no attention to the plank in your own
eye?
42How can you say to your brother,
'Brother, let me take the speck out of
your eye,' when you yourself fail to see
the plank in your own eye? You
hypocrite, first take the plank out of your
eye, and then you will see clearly to
remove the speck from your brother's
eye.
43"No good tree bears bad fruit, nor does
a bad tree bear good fruit.
44Each tree is recognized by its own fruit.
People do not pick figs from
thornbushes, or grapes from briers.
45The good man brings good things out
of the good stored up in his heart, and
the evil man brings evil things out of the
evil stored up in his heart. For out of the
overflow of his heart his mouth speaks.
46"Why do you call me, 'Lord, Lord,' and
do not do what I say?
47I will show you what he is like who
comes to me and hears my words and
puts them into practice.
48He is like a man building a house, who
dug down deep and laid the foundation
on rock. When a flood came, the torrent
struck that house but could not shake it,
because it was well built.
49But the one who hears my words and
does not put them into practice is like a
man who built a house on the ground
without a foundation. The moment the
torrent struck that house, it collapsed
and its destruction was complete."

---lk7.1-7.50 { (ch7)
1When Jesus had finished saying all
this in the hearing of the people, he
entered Capernaum.
2There a centurion's servant, whom his
master valued highly, was sick and
about to die.
3The centurion heard of Jesus and sent
some elders of the Jews to him, asking
him to come and heal his servant.
4When they came to Jesus, they
pleaded earnestly with him, "This man
deserves to have you do this,
5because he loves our nation and has
built our synagogue."
6So Jesus went with them.
7He was not far from the house when
the centurion sent friends to say to him:
"Lord, don't trouble yourself, for I do not
deserve to have you come under my
roof. That is why I did not even consider
myself worthy to come to you. But say
the word, and my servant will be healed.
8For I myself am a man under authority,
with soldiers under me. I tell this one,
'Go,' and he goes; and that one, 'Come,'
and he comes. I say to my servant, 'Do
this,' and he does it."
9When Jesus heard this, he was
amazed at him, and turning to the crowd
following him, he said, "I tell you, I have
not found such great faith even in
Israel."
10Then the men who had been sent
returned to the house and found the
servant well.
11Soon afterward, Jesus went to a town
called Nain, and his disciples and a
large crowd went along with him.
12As he approached the town gate, a
dead person was being carried out--the
only son of his mother, and she was a
widow. And a large crowd from the town
was with her.
13When the Lord saw her, his heart went
out to her and he said, "Don't cry."
14Then he went up and touched the
coffin, and those carrying it stood still.
He said, "Young man, I say to you, get
up!"
15The dead man sat up and began to
talk, and Jesus gave him back to his
mother.
16They were all filled with awe and
praised God. "A great prophet has
appeared among us," they said. "God
has come to help his people."
17This news about Jesus spread
throughout Judea and the surrounding
country.
18John's disciples told him about all
these things. Calling two of them,
19he sent them to the Lord to ask, "Are
you the one who was to come, or should
we expect someone else?"
20When the men came to Jesus, they
said, "John the Baptist sent us to you to
ask, 'Are you the one who was to come,
or should we expect someone else?' "
21At that very time Jesus cured many
who had diseases, sicknesses and evil
spirits, and gave sight to many who
were blind.
22So he replied to the messengers, "Go
back and report to John what you have
seen and heard: The blind receive sight,
the lame walk, those who have leprosy
are cured, the deaf hear, the dead are
raised, and the good news is preached
to the poor.
23Blessed is the man who does not fall
away on account of me."
24After John's messengers left, Jesus
began to speak to the crowd about
John: "What did you go out into the
desert to see? A reed swayed by the
wind?
25If not, what did you go out to see? A
man dressed in fine clothes? No, those
who wear expensive clothes and indulge
in luxury are in palaces.
26But what did you go out to see? A
prophet? Yes, I tell you, and more than
a prophet.
27This is the one about whom it is
written: " 'I will send my messenger
ahead of you, who will prepare your way
before you.'
28I tell you, among those born of women
there is no one greater than John; yet
the one who is least in the kingdom of
God is greater than he."
29(All the people, even the tax collectors,
when they heard Jesus' words,
acknowledged that God's way was right,
because they had been baptized by
John.
30But the Pharisees and experts in the
law rejected God's purpose for
themselves, because they had not been
baptized by John.)
31"To what, then, can I compare the
people of this generation? What are
they like?
32They are like children sitting in the
marketplace and calling out to each
other: " 'We played the flute for you, and
you did not dance; we sang a dirge, and
you did not cry.'
33For John the Baptist came neither
eating bread nor drinking wine, and you
say, 'He has a demon.'
34The Son of Man came eating and
drinking, and you say, 'Here is a glutton
and a drunkard, a friend of tax collectors
and "sinners." '
35But wisdom is proved right by all her
children."
36Now one of the Pharisees invited
Jesus to have dinner with him, so he
went to the Pharisee's house and
reclined at the table.
37When a woman who had lived a sinful
life in that town learned that Jesus was
eating at the Pharisee's house, she
brought an alabaster jar of perfume,
38and as she stood behind him at his
feet weeping, she began to wet his feet
with her tears. Then she wiped them
with her hair, kissed them and poured
perfume on them.
39When the Pharisee who had invited
him saw this, he said to himself, "If this
man were a prophet, he would know
who is touching him and what kind of
woman she is--that she is a sinner."
40Jesus answered him, "Simon, I have
something to tell you." "Tell me,
teacher," he said.
41"Two men owed money to a certain
moneylender. One owed him five
hundred denarii, and the other fifty.
42Neither of them had the money to pay
him back, so he canceled the debts of
both. Now which of them will love him
more?"
43Simon replied, "I suppose the one who
had the bigger debt canceled." "You
have judged correctly," Jesus said.
44Then he turned toward the woman and
said to Simon, "Do you see this woman?
I came into your house. You did not give
me any water for my feet, but she wet
my feet with her tears and wiped them
with her hair.
45You did not give me a kiss, but this
woman, from the time I entered, has not
stopped kissing my feet.
46You did not put oil on my head, but
she has poured perfume on my feet.
47Therefore, I tell you, her many sins
have been forgiven--for she loved much.
But he who has been forgiven little loves
little."
48Then Jesus said to her, "Your sins are
forgiven."
49The other guests began to say among
themselves, "Who is this who even
forgives sins?"
50Jesus said to the woman, "Your faith
has saved you; go in peace."

---lk8.1-8.56 { (ch8)
1After this, Jesus traveled about from
one town and village to another,
proclaiming the good news of the
kingdom of God. The Twelve were with
him,
2and also some women who had been
cured of evil spirits and diseases: Mary
(called Magdalene) from whom seven
demons had come out;
3Joanna the wife of Cuza, the manager
of Herod's household; Susanna; and
many others. These women were
helping to support them out of their own
means.
4While a large crowd was gathering and
people were coming to Jesus from town
after town, he told this parable:
5"A farmer went out to sow his seed. As
he was scattering the seed, some fell
along the path; it was trampled on, and
the birds of the air ate it up.
6Some fell on rock, and when it came up,
the plants withered because they had no
moisture.
7Other seed fell among thorns, which
grew up with it and choked the plants.
8Still other seed fell on good soil. It
came up and yielded a crop, a hundred
times more than was sown." When he
said this, he called out, "He who has
ears to hear, let him hear."
9His disciples asked him what this
parable meant.
10He said, "The knowledge of the
secrets of the kingdom of God has been
given to you, but to others I speak in
parables, so that, " 'though seeing, they
may not see; though hearing, they may
not understand.'
11"This is the meaning of the parable:
The seed is the word of God.
12Those along the path are the ones
who hear, and then the devil comes and
takes away the word from their hearts,
so that they may not believe and be
saved.
13Those on the rock are the ones who
receive the word with joy when they
hear it, but they have no root. They
believe for a while, but in the time of
testing they fall away.
14The seed that fell among thorns
stands for those who hear, but as they
go on their way they are choked by life's
worries, riches and pleasures, and they
do not mature.
15But the seed on good soil stands for
those with a noble and good heart, who
hear the word, retain it, and by
persevering produce a crop.
16"No one lights a lamp and hides it in a
jar or puts it under a bed. Instead, he
puts it on a stand, so that those who
come in can see the light.
17For there is nothing hidden that will not
be disclosed, and nothing concealed
that will not be known or brought out into
the open.
18Therefore consider carefully how you
listen. Whoever has will be given more;
whoever does not have, even what he
thinks he has will be taken from him."
19Now Jesus' mother and brothers came
to see him, but they were not able to get
near him because of the crowd.
20Someone told him, "Your mother and
brothers are standing outside, wanting
to see you."
21He replied, "My mother and brothers
are those who hear God's word and put
it into practice."
22One day Jesus said to his disciples,
"Let's go over to the other side of the
lake." So they got into a boat and set out.
23As they sailed, he fell asleep. A squall
came down on the lake, so that the boat
was being swamped, and they were in
great danger.
24The disciples went and woke him,
saying, "Master, Master, we're going to
drown!"
25He got up and rebuked the wind and
the raging waters; the storm subsided,
and all was calm. "Where is your faith?"
he asked his disciples. In fear and
amazement they asked one another,
"Who is this? He commands even the
winds and the water, and they obey
him."
26They sailed to the region of the
Gerasenes, which is across the lake
from Galilee.
27When Jesus stepped ashore, he was
met by a demon-possessed man from
the town. For a long time this man had
not worn clothes or lived in a house, but
had lived in the tombs.
28When he saw Jesus, he cried out and
fell at his feet, shouting at the top of his
voice, "What do you want with me,
Jesus, Son of the Most High God? I beg
you, don't torture me!"
29For Jesus had commanded the evil
spirit to come out of the man. Many
times it had seized him, and though he
was chained hand and foot and kept
under guard, he had broken his chains
and had been driven by the demon into
solitary places.
30Jesus asked him, "What is your
name?"
31"Legion," he replied, because many
demons had gone into him. And they
begged him repeatedly not to order
them to go into the Abyss.
32A large herd of pigs was feeding there
on the hillside. The demons begged
Jesus to let them go into them, and he
gave them permission.
33When the demons came out of the
man, they went into the pigs, and the
herd rushed down the steep bank into
the lake and was drowned.
34When those tending the pigs saw what
had happened, they ran off and reported
this in the town and countryside,
35and the people went out to see what
had happened. When they came to
Jesus, they found the man from whom
the demons had gone out, sitting at
Jesus' feet, dressed and in his right
mind; and they were afraid.
36Those who had seen it told the people
how the demon-possessed man had
been cured.
37Then all the people of the region of the
Gerasenes asked Jesus to leave them,
because they were overcome with fear.
So he got into the boat and left.
38The man from whom the demons had
gone out begged to go with him, but
Jesus sent him away, saying,
39"Return home and tell how much God
has done for you." So the man went
away and told all over town how much
Jesus had done for him.
40Now when Jesus returned, a crowd
welcomed him, for they were all
expecting him.
41Then a man named Jairus, a ruler of
the synagogue, came and fell at Jesus'
feet, pleading with him to come to his
house
42because his only daughter, a girl of
about twelve, was dying.
43As Jesus was on his way, the crowds
almost crushed him. And a woman was
there who had been subject to bleeding
for twelve years, but no one could heal
her.
44She came up behind him and touched
the edge of his cloak, and immediately
her bleeding stopped.
45"Who touched me?" Jesus asked.
When they all denied it, Peter said,
"Master, the people are crowding and
pressing against you."
46But Jesus said, "Someone touched
me; I know that power has gone out
from me."
47Then the woman, seeing that she
could not go unnoticed, came trembling
and fell at his feet. In the presence of all
the people, she told why she had
touched him and how she had been
instantly healed.
48Then he said to her, "Daughter, your
faith has healed you. Go in peace."
49While Jesus was still speaking,
someone came from the house of Jairus,
the synagogue ruler. "Your daughter is
dead," he said. "Don't bother the teacher
any more."
50Hearing this, Jesus said to Jairus,
"Don't be afraid; just believe, and she
will be healed."
51When he arrived at the house of Jairus,
he did not let anyone go in with him
except Peter, John and James, and the
child's father and mother.
52Meanwhile, all the people were wailing
and mourning for her. "Stop wailing,"
Jesus said. "She is not dead but
asleep."
53They laughed at him, knowing that she
was dead.
54But he took her by the hand and said,
"My child, get up!"
55Her spirit returned, and at once she
stood up. Then Jesus told them to give
her something to eat.
56Her parents were astonished, but he
ordered them not to tell anyone what
had happened.

---lk9.1-9.62 { (ch9)
1When Jesus had called the Twelve
together, he gave them power and
authority to drive out all demons and to
cure diseases,
2and he sent them out to preach the
kingdom of God and to heal the sick.
3He told them: "Take nothing for the
journey--no staff, no bag, no bread, no
money, no extra tunic.
4Whatever house you enter, stay there
until you leave that town.
5If people do not welcome you, shake
the dust off your feet when you leave
their town, as a testimony against them."
6So they set out and went from village to
village, preaching the gospel and
healing people everywhere.
7Now Herod the tetrarch heard about all
that was going on. And he was
perplexed, because some were saying
that John had been raised from the
dead,
8others that Elijah had appeared, and
still others that one of the prophets of
long ago had come back to life.
9But Herod said, "I beheaded John. Who,
then, is this I hear such things about?"
And he tried to see him.
10When the apostles returned, they
reported to Jesus what they had done.
Then he took them with him and they
withdrew by themselves to a town called
Bethsaida,
11but the crowds learned about it and
followed him. He welcomed them and
spoke to them about the kingdom of
God, and healed those who needed
healing.
12Late in the afternoon the Twelve came
to him and said, "Send the crowd away
so they can go to the surrounding
villages and countryside and find food
and lodging, because we are in a
remote place here."
13He replied, "You give them something
to eat."
14They answered, "We have only five
loaves of bread and two fish--unless we
go and buy food for all this crowd."
(About five thousand men were there.)
15But he said to his disciples, "Have
them sit down in groups of about fifty
each." The disciples did so, and
everybody sat down.
16Taking the five loaves and the two fish
and looking up to heaven, he gave
thanks and broke them. Then he gave
them to the disciples to set before the
people.
17They all ate and were satisfied, and
the disciples picked up twelve basketfuls
of broken pieces that were left over.
18Once when Jesus was praying in
private and his disciples were with him,
he asked them, "Who do the crowds say
I am?"
19They replied, "Some say John the
Baptist; others say Elijah; and still others,
that one of the prophets of long ago has
come back to life."
20"But what about you?" he asked. "Who
do you say I am?" Peter answered, "The
Christ of God."
21Jesus strictly warned them not to tell
this to anyone.
22And he said, "The Son of Man must
suffer many things and be rejected by
the elders, chief priests and teachers of
the law, and he must be killed and on
the third day be raised to life."
23Then he said to them all: "If anyone
would come after me, he must deny
himself and take up his cross daily and
follow me.
24For whoever wants to save his life will
lose it, but whoever loses his life for me
will save it.
25What good is it for a man to gain the
whole world, and yet lose or forfeit his
very self?
26If anyone is ashamed of me and my
words, the Son of Man will be ashamed
of him when he comes in his glory and
in the glory of the Father and of the holy
angels.
27I tell you the truth, some who are
standing here will not taste death before
they see the kingdom of God."
28About eight days after Jesus said this,
he took Peter, John and James with him
and went up onto a mountain to pray.
29As he was praying, the appearance of
his face changed, and his clothes
became as bright as a flash of lightning.
30Two men, Moses and Elijah,
31appeared in glorious splendor, talking
with Jesus. They spoke about his
departure, which he was about to bring
to fulfillment at Jerusalem.
32Peter and his companions were very
sleepy, but when they became fully
awake, they saw his glory and the two
men standing with him.
33As the men were leaving Jesus, Peter
said to him, "Master, it is good for us to
be here. Let us put up three shelters--
one for you, one for Moses and one for
Elijah." (He did not know what he was
saying.)
34While he was speaking, a cloud
appeared and enveloped them, and they
were afraid as they entered the cloud.
35A voice came from the cloud, saying,
"This is my Son, whom I have chosen;
listen to him."
36When the voice had spoken, they
found that Jesus was alone. The
disciples kept this to themselves, and
told no one at that time what they had
seen.
37The next day, when they came down
from the mountain, a large crowd met
him.
38A man in the crowd called out,
"Teacher, I beg you to look at my son,
for he is my only child.
39A spirit seizes him and he suddenly
screams; it throws him into convulsions
so that he foams at the mouth. It
scarcely ever leaves him and is
destroying him.
40I begged your disciples to drive it out,
but they could not."
41"O unbelieving and perverse
generation," Jesus replied, "how long
shall I stay with you and put up with
you? Bring your son here."
42Even while the boy was coming, the
demon threw him to the ground in a
convulsion. But Jesus rebuked the evil
spirit, healed the boy and gave him back
to his father.
43And they were all amazed at the
greatness of God.
44While everyone was marveling at all
that Jesus did, he said to his disciples,
"Listen carefully to what I am about to
tell you: The Son of Man is going to be
betrayed into the hands of men."
45But they did not understand what this
meant. It was hidden from them, so that
they did not grasp it, and they were
afraid to ask him about it.
46An argument started among the
disciples as to which of them would be
the greatest.
47Jesus, knowing their thoughts, took a
little child and had him stand beside him.
48Then he said to them, "Whoever
welcomes this little child in my name
welcomes me; and whoever welcomes
me welcomes the one who sent me. For
he who is least among you all--he is the
greatest."
49"Master," said John, "we saw a man
driving out demons in your name and
we tried to stop him, because he is not
one of us."
50"Do not stop him," Jesus said, "for
whoever is not against you is for you."
51As the time approached for him to be
taken up to heaven, Jesus resolutely set
out for Jerusalem.
52And he sent messengers on ahead,
who went into a Samaritan village to get
things ready for him;
53but the people there did not welcome
him, because he was heading for
Jerusalem.
54When the disciples James and John
saw this, they asked, "Lord, do you want
us to call fire down from heaven to
destroy them ?"
55But Jesus turned and rebuked them,
56and they went to another village.
57As they were walking along the road, a
man said to him, "I will follow you
wherever you go."
58Jesus replied, "Foxes have holes and
birds of the air have nests, but the Son
of Man has no place to lay his head."
59He said to another man, "Follow me."
But the man replied, "Lord, first let me
go and bury my father."
60Jesus said to him, "Let the dead bury
their own dead, but you go and proclaim
the kingdom of God."
61Still another said, "I will follow you,
Lord; but first let me go back and say
good-by to my family."
62Jesus replied, "No one who puts his
hand to the plow and looks back is fit for
service in the kingdom of God."

10After this the Lord appointed
seventy-two others and sent them two
by two ahead of him to every town and
place where he was about to go.
2He told them, "The harvest is plentiful,
but the workers are few. Ask the Lord of
the harvest, therefore, to send out
workers into his harvest field.
3Go! I am sending you out like lambs
among wolves.
4Do not take a purse or bag or sandals;
and do not greet anyone on the road.
5"When you enter a house, first say,
'Peace to this house.'
6If a man of peace is there, your peace
will rest on him; if not, it will return to you.
7Stay in that house, eating and drinking
whatever they give you, for the worker
deserves his wages. Do not move
around from house to house.
8"When you enter a town and are
welcomed, eat what is set before you.
9Heal the sick who are there and tell
them, 'The kingdom of God is near you.'
10But when you enter a town and are not
welcomed, go into its streets and say,
11'Even the dust of your town that sticks
to our feet we wipe off against you. Yet
be sure of this: The kingdom of God is
near.'
12I tell you, it will be more bearable on
that day for Sodom than for that town.
13"Woe to you, Korazin! Woe to you,
Bethsaida! For if the miracles that were
performed in you had been performed in
Tyre and Sidon, they would have
repented long ago, sitting in sackcloth
and ashes.
14But it will be more bearable for Tyre
and Sidon at the judgment than for you.
15And you, Capernaum, will you be lifted
up to the skies? No, you will go down to
the depths.
16"He who listens to you listens to me;
he who rejects you rejects me; but he
who rejects me rejects him who sent
me."
17The seventy-two returned with joy and
said, "Lord, even the demons submit to
us in your name."
18He replied, "I saw Satan fall like
lightning from heaven.
19I have given you authority to trample
on snakes and scorpions and to
overcome all the power of the enemy;
nothing will harm you.
20However, do not rejoice that the spirits
submit to you, but rejoice that your
names are written in heaven."
21At that time Jesus, full of joy through
the Holy Spirit, said, "I praise you,
Father, Lord of heaven and earth,
because you have hidden these things
from the wise and learned, and revealed
them to little children. Yes, Father, for
this was your good pleasure.
22"All things have been committed to me
by my Father. No one knows who the
Son is except the Father, and no one
knows who the Father is except the Son
and those to whom the Son chooses to
reveal him."
23Then he turned to his disciples and
said privately, "Blessed are the eyes
that see what you see.
24For I tell you that many prophets and
kings wanted to see what you see but
did not see it, and to hear what you hear
but did not hear it."
25On one occasion an expert in the law
stood up to test Jesus. "Teacher," he
asked, "what must I do to inherit eternal
life?"
26"What is written in the Law?" he
replied. "How do you read it?"
27He answered: " 'Love the Lord your
God with all your heart and with all your
soul and with all your strength and with
all your mind' ; and, 'Love your neighbor
as yourself.' "
28"You have answered correctly," Jesus
replied. "Do this and you will live."
29But he wanted to justify himself, so he
asked Jesus, "And who is my
neighbor?"
30In reply Jesus said: "A man was going
down from Jerusalem to Jericho, when
he fell into the hands of robbers. They
stripped him of his clothes, beat him and
went away, leaving him half dead.
31A priest happened to be going down
the same road, and when he saw the
man, he passed by on the other side.
32So too, a Levite, when he came to the
place and saw him, passed by on the
other side.
33But a Samaritan, as he traveled, came
where the man was; and when he saw
him, he took pity on him.
34He went to him and bandaged his
wounds, pouring on oil and wine. Then
he put the man on his own donkey, took
him to an inn and took care of him.
35The next day he took out two silver
coins and gave them to the innkeeper.
'Look after him,' he said, 'and when I
return, I will reimburse you for any extra
expense you may have.'
36"Which of these three do you think was
a neighbor to the man who fell into the
hands of robbers?"
37The expert in the law replied, "The one
who had mercy on him." Jesus told him,
"Go and do likewise."
38As Jesus and his disciples were on
their way, he came to a village where a
woman named Martha opened her
home to him.
39She had a sister called Mary, who sat
at the Lord's feet listening to what he
said.
40But Martha was distracted by all the
preparations that had to be made. She
came to him and asked, "Lord, don't you
care that my sister has left me to do the
work by myself? Tell her to help me!"
41"Martha, Martha," the Lord answered,
"you are worried and upset about many
things,
42but only one thing is needed. Mary has
chosen what is better, and it will not be
taken away from her."

1One day Jesus was praying in a
certain place. When he finished, one of
his disciples said to him, "Lord, teach us
to pray, just as John taught his
disciples."
2He said to them, "When you pray, say:
" 'Father, hallowed be your name, your
kingdom come.
3Give us each day our daily bread.
4Forgive us our sins, for we also forgive
everyone who sins against us. And lead
us not into temptation. ' "
5Then he said to them, "Suppose one of
you has a friend, and he goes to him at
midnight and says, 'Friend, lend me
three loaves of bread,
6because a friend of mine on a journey
has come to me, and I have nothing to
set before him.'
7"Then the one inside answers, 'Don't
bother me. The door is already locked,
and my children are with me in bed. I
can't get up and give you anything.'
8I tell you, though he will not get up and
give him the bread because he is his
friend, yet because of the man's
boldness he will get up and give him as
much as he needs.
9"So I say to you: Ask and it will be
given to you; seek and you will find;
knock and the door will be opened to
you.
10For everyone who asks receives; he
who seeks finds; and to him who knocks,
the door will be opened.
11"Which of you fathers, if your son asks
for a fish, will give him a snake instead?
12Or if he asks for an egg, will give him a
scorpion?
13If you then, though you are evil, know
how to give good gifts to your children,
how much more will your Father in
heaven give the Holy Spirit to those who
ask him!"
14Jesus was driving out a demon that
was mute. When the demon left, the
man who had been mute spoke, and the
crowd was amazed.
15But some of them said, "By Beelzebub,
the prince of demons, he is driving out
demons."
16Others tested him by asking for a sign
from heaven.
17Jesus knew their thoughts and said to
them: "Any kingdom divided against
itself will be ruined, and a house divided
against itself will fall.
18If Satan is divided against himself, how
can his kingdom stand? I say this
because you claim that I drive out
demons by Beelzebub.
19Now if I drive out demons by
Beelzebub, by whom do your followers
drive them out? So then, they will be
your judges.
20But if I drive out demons by the finger
of God, then the kingdom of God has
come to you.
21"When a strong man, fully armed,
guards his own house, his possessions
are safe.
22But when someone stronger attacks
and overpowers him, he takes away the
armor in which the man trusted and
divides up the spoils.
23"He who is not with me is against me,
and he who does not gather with me,
scatters.
24"When an evil spirit comes out of a
man, it goes through arid places seeking
rest and does not find it. Then it says, 'I
will return to the house I left.'
25When it arrives, it finds the house
swept clean and put in order.
26Then it goes and takes seven other
spirits more wicked than itself, and they
go in and live there. And the final
condition of that man is worse than the
first."
27As Jesus was saying these things, a
woman in the crowd called out, "Blessed
is the mother who gave you birth and
nursed you."
28He replied, "Blessed rather are those
who hear the word of God and obey it."
29As the crowds increased, Jesus said,
"This is a wicked generation. It asks for
a miraculous sign, but none will be given
it except the sign of Jonah.
30For as Jonah was a sign to the
Ninevites, so also will the Son of Man be
to this generation.
31The Queen of the South will rise at the
judgment with the men of this
generation and condemn them; for she
came from the ends of the earth to listen
to Solomon's wisdom, and now one
greater than Solomon is here.
32The men of Nineveh will stand up at
the judgment with this generation and
condemn it; for they repented at the
preaching of Jonah, and now one
greater than Jonah is here.
33"No one lights a lamp and puts it in a
place where it will be hidden, or under a
bowl. Instead he puts it on its stand, so
that those who come in may see the
light.
34Your eye is the lamp of your body.
When your eyes are good, your whole
body also is full of light. But when they
are bad, your body also is full of
darkness.
35See to it, then, that the light within you
is not darkness.
36Therefore, if your whole body is full of
light, and no part of it dark, it will be
completely lighted, as when the light of
a lamp shines on you."
37When Jesus had finished speaking, a
Pharisee invited him to eat with him; so
he went in and reclined at the table.
38But the Pharisee, noticing that Jesus
did not first wash before the meal, was
surprised.
39Then the Lord said to him, "Now then,
you Pharisees clean the outside of the
cup and dish, but inside you are full of
greed and wickedness.
40You foolish people! Did not the one
who made the outside make the inside
also?
41But give what is inside the dish to the
poor, and everything will be clean for
you.
42"Woe to you Pharisees, because you
give God a tenth of your mint, rue and
all other kinds of garden herbs, but you
neglect justice and the love of God. You
should have practiced the latter without
leaving the former undone.
43"Woe to you Pharisees, because you
love the most important seats in the
synagogues and greetings in the
marketplaces.
44"Woe to you, because you are like
unmarked graves, which men walk over
without knowing it."
45One of the experts in the law
answered him, "Teacher, when you say
these things, you insult us also."
46Jesus replied, "And you experts in the
law, woe to you, because you load
people down with burdens they can
hardly carry, and you yourselves will not
lift one finger to help them.
47"Woe to you, because you build tombs
for the prophets, and it was your
forefathers who killed them.
48So you testify that you approve of what
your forefathers did; they killed the
prophets, and you build their tombs.
49Because of this, God in his wisdom
said, 'I will send them prophets and
apostles, some of whom they will kill
and others they will persecute.'
50Therefore this generation will be held
responsible for the blood of all the
prophets that has been shed since the
beginning of the world,
51from the blood of Abel to the blood of
Zechariah, who was killed between the
altar and the sanctuary. Yes, I tell you,
this generation will be held responsible
for it all.
52"Woe to you experts in the law,
because you have taken away the key
to knowledge. You yourselves have not
entered, and you have hindered those
who were entering."
53When Jesus left there, the Pharisees
and the teachers of the law began to
oppose him fiercely and to besiege him
with questions,
54waiting to catch him in something he
might say.

1Meanwhile, when a crowd of
many thousands had gathered, so that
they were trampling on one another,
Jesus began to speak first to his
disciples, saying: "Be on your guard
against the yeast of the Pharisees,
which is hypocrisy.
2There is nothing concealed that will not
be disclosed, or hidden that will not be
made known.
3What you have said in the dark will be
heard in the daylight, and what you have
whispered in the ear in the inner rooms
will be proclaimed from the roofs.
4"I tell you, my friends, do not be afraid
of those who kill the body and after that
can do no more.
5But I will show you whom you should
fear: Fear him who, after the killing of
the body, has power to throw you into
hell. Yes, I tell you, fear him.
6Are not five sparrows sold for two
pennies ? Yet not one of them is
forgotten by God.
7Indeed, the very hairs of your head are
all numbered. Don't be afraid; you are
worth more than many sparrows.
8"I tell you, whoever acknowledges me
before men, the Son of Man will also
acknowledge him before the angels of
God.
9But he who disowns me before men will
be disowned before the angels of God.
10And everyone who speaks a word
against the Son of Man will be forgiven,
but anyone who blasphemes against the
Holy Spirit will not be forgiven.
11"When you are brought before
synagogues, rulers and authorities, do
not worry about how you will defend
yourselves or what you will say,
12for the Holy Spirit will teach you at that
time what you should say."
13Someone in the crowd said to him,
"Teacher, tell my brother to divide the
inheritance with me."
14Jesus replied, "Man, who appointed
me a judge or an arbiter between you?"
15Then he said to them, "Watch out! Be
on your guard against all kinds of greed;
a man's life does not consist in the
abundance of his possessions."
16And he told them this parable: "The
ground of a certain rich man produced a
good crop.
17He thought to himself, 'What shall I
do? I have no place to store my crops.'
18"Then he said, 'This is what I'll do. I will
tear down my barns and build bigger
ones, and there I will store all my grain
and my goods.
19And I'll say to myself, "You have plenty
of good things laid up for many years.
Take life easy; eat, drink and be merry."
'
20"But God said to him, 'You fool! This
very night your life will be demanded
from you. Then who will get what you
have prepared for yourself?'
21"This is how it will be with anyone who
stores up things for himself but is not
rich toward God."
22Then Jesus said to his disciples:
"Therefore I tell you, do not worry about
your life, what you will eat; or about your
body, what you will wear.
23Life is more than food, and the body
more than clothes.
24Consider the ravens: They do not sow
or reap, they have no storeroom or barn;
yet God feeds them. And how much
more valuable you are than birds!
25Who of you by worrying can add a
single hour to his life ?
26Since you cannot do this very little
thing, why do you worry about the rest?
27"Consider how the lilies grow. They do
not labor or spin. Yet I tell you, not even
Solomon in all his splendor was dressed
like one of these.
28If that is how God clothes the grass of
the field, which is here today, and
tomorrow is thrown into the fire, how
much more will he clothe you, O you of
little faith!
29And do not set your heart on what you
will eat or drink; do not worry about it.
30For the pagan world runs after all such
things, and your Father knows that you
need them.
31But seek his kingdom, and these
things will be given to you as well.
32"Do not be afraid, little flock, for your
Father has been pleased to give you the
kingdom.
33Sell your possessions and give to the
poor. Provide purses for yourselves that
will not wear out, a treasure in heaven
that will not be exhausted, where no
thief comes near and no moth destroys.
34For where your treasure is, there your
heart will be also.
35"Be dressed ready for service and
keep your lamps burning,
36like men waiting for their master to
return from a wedding banquet, so that
when he comes and knocks they can
immediately open the door for him.
37It will be good for those servants
whose master finds them watching
when he comes. I tell you the truth, he
will dress himself to serve, will have
them recline at the table and will come
and wait on them.
38It will be good for those servants
whose master finds them ready, even if
he comes in the second or third watch of
the night.
39But understand this: If the owner of the
house had known at what hour the thief
was coming, he would not have let his
house be broken into.
40You also must be ready, because the
Son of Man will come at an hour when
you do not expect him."
41Peter asked, "Lord, are you telling this
parable to us, or to everyone?"
42The Lord answered, "Who then is the
faithful and wise manager, whom the
master puts in charge of his servants to
give them their food allowance at the
proper time?
43It will be good for that servant whom
the master finds doing so when he
returns.
44I tell you the truth, he will put him in
charge of all his possessions.
45But suppose the servant says to
himself, 'My master is taking a long time
in coming,' and he then begins to beat
the menservants and maidservants and
to eat and drink and get drunk.
46The master of that servant will come
on a day when he does not expect him
and at an hour he is not aware of. He
will cut him to pieces and assign him a
place with the unbelievers.
47"That servant who knows his master's
will and does not get ready or does not
do what his master wants will be beaten
with many blows.
48But the one who does not know and
does things deserving punishment will
be beaten with few blows. From
everyone who has been given much,
much will be demanded; and from the
one who has been entrusted with much,
much more will be asked.
49"I have come to bring fire on the earth,
and how I wish it were already kindled!
50But I have a baptism to undergo, and
how distressed I am until it is completed!
51Do you think I came to bring peace on
earth? No, I tell you, but division.
52From now on there will be five in one
family divided against each other, three
against two and two against three.
53They will be divided, father against son
and son against father, mother against
daughter and daughter against mother,
mother-in-law against daughter-in-law
and daughter-in-law against mother-inlaw."
54He said to the crowd: "When you see a
cloud rising in the west, immediately you
say, 'It's going to rain,' and it does.
55And when the south wind blows, you
say, 'It's going to be hot,' and it is.
56Hypocrites! You know how to interpret
the appearance of the earth and the sky.
How is it that you don't know how to
interpret this present time?
57"Why don't you judge for yourselves
what is right?
58As you are going with your adversary
to the magistrate, try hard to be
reconciled to him on the way, or he may
drag you off to the judge, and the judge
turn you over to the officer, and the
officer throw you into prison.
59I tell you, you will not get out until you
have paid the last penny. "

1Now there were some present at
that time who told Jesus about the
Galileans whose blood Pilate had mixed
with their sacrifices.
2Jesus answered, "Do you think that
these Galileans were worse sinners
than all the other Galileans because
they suffered this way?
3I tell you, no! But unless you repent,
you too will all perish.
4Or those eighteen who died when the
tower in Siloam fell on them--do you
think they were more guilty than all the
others living in Jerusalem?
5I tell you, no! But unless you repent,
you too will all perish."
6Then he told this parable: "A man had a
fig tree, planted in his vineyard, and he
went to look for fruit on it, but did not
find any.
7So he said to the man who took care of
the vineyard, 'For three years now I've
been coming to look for fruit on this fig
tree and haven't found any. Cut it down!
Why should it use up the soil?'
8" 'Sir,' the man replied, 'leave it alone
for one more year, and I'll dig around it
and fertilize it.
9If it bears fruit next year, fine! If not,
then cut it down.' "
10On a Sabbath Jesus was teaching in
one of the synagogues,
11and a woman was there who had been
crippled by a spirit for eighteen years.
She was bent over and could not
straighten up at all.
12When Jesus saw her, he called her
forward and said to her, "Woman, you
are set free from your infirmity."
13Then he put his hands on her, and
immediately she straightened up and
praised God.
14Indignant because Jesus had healed
on the Sabbath, the synagogue ruler
said to the people, "There are six days
for work. So come and be healed on
those days, not on the Sabbath."
15The Lord answered him, "You
hypocrites! Doesn't each of you on the
Sabbath untie his ox or donkey from the
stall and lead it out to give it water?
16Then should not this woman, a
daughter of Abraham, whom Satan has
kept bound for eighteen long years, be
set free on the Sabbath day from what
bound her?"
17When he said this, all his opponents
were humiliated, but the people were
delighted with all the wonderful things
he was doing.
18Then Jesus asked, "What is the
kingdom of God like? What shall I
compare it to?
19It is like a mustard seed, which a man
took and planted in his garden. It grew
and became a tree, and the birds of the
air perched in its branches."
20Again he asked, "What shall I compare
the kingdom of God to?
21It is like yeast that a woman took and
mixed into a large amount of flour until it
worked all through the dough."
22Then Jesus went through the towns
and villages, teaching as he made his
way to Jerusalem.
23Someone asked him, "Lord, are only a
few people going to be saved?"
24He said to them, "Make every effort to
enter through the narrow door, because
many, I tell you, will try to enter and will
not be able to.
25Once the owner of the house gets up
and closes the door, you will stand
outside knocking and pleading, 'Sir,
open the door for us.' "But he will
answer, 'I don't know you or where you
come from.'
26"Then you will say, 'We ate and drank
with you, and you taught in our streets.'
27"But he will reply, 'I don't know you or
where you come from. Away from me,
all you evildoers!'
28"There will be weeping there, and
gnashing of teeth, when you see
Abraham, Isaac and Jacob and all the
prophets in the kingdom of God, but you
yourselves thrown out.
29People will come from east and west
and north and south, and will take their
places at the feast in the kingdom of
God.
30Indeed there are those who are last
who will be first, and first who will be
last."
31At that time some Pharisees came to
Jesus and said to him, "Leave this place
and go somewhere else. Herod wants to
kill you."
32He replied, "Go tell that fox, 'I will drive
out demons and heal people today and
tomorrow, and on the third day I will
reach my goal.'
33In any case, I must keep going today
and tomorrow and the next day--for
surely no prophet can die outside
Jerusalem!
34"O Jerusalem, Jerusalem, you who kill
the prophets and stone those sent to
you, how often I have longed to gather
your children together, as a hen gathers
her chicks under her wings, but you
were not willing!
35Look, your house is left to you
desolate. I tell you, you will not see me
again until you say, 'Blessed is he who
comes in the name of the Lord.' "

1One Sabbath, when Jesus went to
eat in the house of a prominent
Pharisee, he was being carefully
watched.
2There in front of him was a man
suffering from dropsy.
3Jesus asked the Pharisees and experts
in the law, "Is it lawful to heal on the
Sabbath or not?"
4But they remained silent. So taking hold
of the man, he healed him and sent him
away.
5Then he asked them, "If one of you has
a son or an ox that falls into a well on
the Sabbath day, will you not
immediately pull him out?"
6And they had nothing to say.
7When he noticed how the guests
picked the places of honor at the table,
he told them this parable:
8"When someone invites you to a
wedding feast, do not take the place of
honor, for a person more distinguished
than you may have been invited.
9If so, the host who invited both of you
will come and say to you, 'Give this man
your seat.' Then, humiliated, you will
have to take the least important place.
10But when you are invited, take the
lowest place, so that when your host
comes, he will say to you, 'Friend, move
up to a better place.' Then you will be
honored in the presence of all your
fellow guests.
11For everyone who exalts himself will
be humbled, and he who humbles
himself will be exalted."
12Then Jesus said to his host, "When
you give a luncheon or dinner, do not
invite your friends, your brothers or
relatives, or your rich neighbors; if you
do, they may invite you back and so you
will be repaid.
13But when you give a banquet, invite
the poor, the crippled, the lame, the
blind,
14and you will be blessed. Although they
cannot repay you, you will be repaid at
the resurrection of the righteous."
15When one of those at the table with
him heard this, he said to Jesus,
"Blessed is the man who will eat at the
feast in the kingdom of God."
16Jesus replied: "A certain man was
preparing a great banquet and invited
many guests.
17At the time of the banquet he sent his
servant to tell those who had been
invited, 'Come, for everything is now
ready.'
18"But they all alike began to make
excuses. The first said, 'I have just
bought a field, and I must go and see it.
Please excuse me.'
19"Another said, 'I have just bought five
yoke of oxen, and I'm on my way to try
them out. Please excuse me.'
20"Still another said, 'I just got married,
so I can't come.'
21"The servant came back and reported
this to his master. Then the owner of the
house became angry and ordered his
servant, 'Go out quickly into the streets
and alleys of the town and bring in the
poor, the crippled, the blind and the
lame.'
22" 'Sir,' the servant said, 'what you
ordered has been done, but there is still
room.'
23"Then the master told his servant, 'Go
out to the roads and country lanes and
make them come in, so that my house
will be full.
24I tell you, not one of those men who
were invited will get a taste of my
banquet.' "
25Large crowds were traveling with
Jesus, and turning to them he said:
26"If anyone comes to me and does not
hate his father and mother, his wife and
children, his brothers and sisters--yes,
even his own life--he cannot be my
disciple.
27And anyone who does not carry his
cross and follow me cannot be my
disciple.
28"Suppose one of you wants to build a
tower. Will he not first sit down and
estimate the cost to see if he has
enough money to complete it?
29For if he lays the foundation and is not
able to finish it, everyone who sees it
will ridicule him,
30saying, 'This fellow began to build and
was not able to finish.'
31"Or suppose a king is about to go to
war against another king. Will he not
first sit down and consider whether he is
able with ten thousand men to oppose
the one coming against him with twenty
thousand?
32If he is not able, he will send a
delegation while the other is still a long
way off and will ask for terms of peace.
33In the same way, any of you who does
not give up everything he has cannot be
my disciple.
34"Salt is good, but if it loses its saltiness,
how can it be made salty again?
35It is fit neither for the soil nor for the
manure pile; it is thrown out. "He who
has ears to hear, let him hear."

1Now the tax collectors and
"sinners" were all gathering around to
hear him.
2But the Pharisees and the teachers of
the law muttered, "This man welcomes
sinners and eats with them."
3Then Jesus told them this parable:
4"Suppose one of you has a hundred
sheep and loses one of them. Does he
not leave the ninety-nine in the open
country and go after the lost sheep until
he finds it?
5And when he finds it, he joyfully puts it
on his shoulders
6and goes home. Then he calls his
friends and neighbors together and says,
'Rejoice with me; I have found my lost
sheep.'
7I tell you that in the same way there will
be more rejoicing in heaven over one
sinner who repents than over ninetynine
righteous persons who do not need
to repent.
8"Or suppose a woman has ten silver
coins and loses one. Does she not light
a lamp, sweep the house and search
carefully until she finds it?
9And when she finds it, she calls her
friends and neighbors together and says,
'Rejoice with me; I have found my lost
coin.'
10In the same way, I tell you, there is
rejoicing in the presence of the angels of
God over one sinner who repents."
11Jesus continued: "There was a man
who had two sons.
12The younger one said to his father,
'Father, give me my share of the estate.'
So he divided his property between
them.
13"Not long after that, the younger son
got together all he had, set off for a
distant country and there squandered
his wealth in wild living.
14After he had spent everything, there
was a severe famine in that whole
country, and he began to be in need.
15So he went and hired himself out to a
citizen of that country, who sent him to
his fields to feed pigs.
16He longed to fill his stomach with the
pods that the pigs were eating, but no
one gave him anything.
17"When he came to his senses, he said,
'How many of my father's hired men
have food to spare, and here I am
starving to death!
18I will set out and go back to my father
and say to him: Father, I have sinned
against heaven and against you.
19I am no longer worthy to be called your
son; make me like one of your hired
men.'
20So he got up and went to his father.
"But while he was still a long way off, his
father saw him and was filled with
compassion for him; he ran to his son,
threw his arms around him and kissed
him.
21"The son said to him, 'Father, I have
sinned against heaven and against you.
I am no longer worthy to be called your
son. '
22"But the father said to his servants,
'Quick! Bring the best robe and put it on
him. Put a ring on his finger and sandals
on his feet.
23Bring the fattened calf and kill it. Let's
have a feast and celebrate.
24For this son of mine was dead and is
alive again; he was lost and is found.'
So they began to celebrate.
25"Meanwhile, the older son was in the
field. When he came near the house, he
heard music and dancing.
26So he called one of the servants and
asked him what was going on.
27'Your brother has come,' he replied,
'and your father has killed the fattened
calf because he has him back safe and
sound.'
28"The older brother became angry and
refused to go in. So his father went out
and pleaded with him.
29But he answered his father, 'Look! All
these years I've been slaving for you
and never disobeyed your orders. Yet
you never gave me even a young goat
so I could celebrate with my friends.
30But when this son of yours who has
squandered your property with
prostitutes comes home, you kill the
fattened calf for him!'
31" 'My son,' the father said, 'you are
always with me, and everything I have is
yours.
32But we had to celebrate and be glad,
because this brother of yours was dead
and is alive again; he was lost and is
found.' "

1Jesus told his disciples: "There
was a rich man whose manager was
accused of wasting his possessions.
2So he called him in and asked him,
'What is this I hear about you? Give an
account of your management, because
you cannot be manager any longer.'
3"The manager said to himself, 'What
shall I do now? My master is taking
away my job. I'm not strong enough to
dig, and I'm ashamed to beg--
4I know what I'll do so that, when I lose
my job here, people will welcome me
into their houses.'
5"So he called in each one of his
master's debtors. He asked the first,
'How much do you owe my master?'
6" 'Eight hundred gallons of olive oil,' he
replied. "The manager told him, 'Take
your bill, sit down quickly, and make it
four hundred.'
7"Then he asked the second, 'And how
much do you owe?' " 'A thousand
bushels of wheat,' he replied. "He told
him, 'Take your bill and make it eight
hundred.'
8"The master commended the dishonest
manager because he had acted
shrewdly. For the people of this world
are more shrewd in dealing with their
own kind than are the people of the light.
9I tell you, use worldly wealth to gain
friends for yourselves, so that when it is
gone, you will be welcomed into eternal
dwellings.
10"Whoever can be trusted with very little
can also be trusted with much, and
whoever is dishonest with very little will
also be dishonest with much.
11So if you have not been trustworthy in
handling worldly wealth, who will trust
you with true riches?
12And if you have not been trustworthy
with someone else's property, who will
give you property of your own?
13"No servant can serve two masters.
Either he will hate the one and love the
other, or he will be devoted to the one
and despise the other. You cannot serve
both God and Money."
14The Pharisees, who loved money,
heard all this and were sneering at
Jesus.
15He said to them, "You are the ones
who justify yourselves in the eyes of
men, but God knows your hearts. What
is highly valued among men is
detestable in God's sight.
16"The Law and the Prophets were
proclaimed until John. Since that time,
the good news of the kingdom of God is
being preached, and everyone is forcing
his way into it.
17It is easier for heaven and earth to
disappear than for the least stroke of a
pen to drop out of the Law.
18"Anyone who divorces his wife and
marries another woman commits
adultery, and the man who marries a
divorced woman commits adultery.
19"There was a rich man who was
dressed in purple and fine linen and
lived in luxury every day.
20At his gate was laid a beggar named
Lazarus, covered with sores
21and longing to eat what fell from the
rich man's table. Even the dogs came
and licked his sores.
22"The time came when the beggar died
and the angels carried him to Abraham's
side. The rich man also died and was
buried.
23In hell, where he was in torment, he
looked up and saw Abraham far away,
with Lazarus by his side.
24So he called to him, 'Father Abraham,
have pity on me and send Lazarus to
dip the tip of his finger in water and cool
my tongue, because I am in agony in
this fire.'
25"But Abraham replied, 'Son, remember
that in your lifetime you received your
good things, while Lazarus received bad
things, but now he is comforted here
and you are in agony.
26And besides all this, between us and
you a great chasm has been fixed, so
that those who want to go from here to
you cannot, nor can anyone cross over
from there to us.'
27"He answered, 'Then I beg you, father,
send Lazarus to my father's house,
28for I have five brothers. Let him warn
them, so that they will not also come to
this place of torment.'
29"Abraham replied, 'They have Moses
and the Prophets; let them listen to
them.'
30" 'No, father Abraham,' he said, 'but if
someone from the dead goes to them,
they will repent.'
31"He said to him, 'If they do not listen to
Moses and the Prophets, they will not
be convinced even if someone rises
from the dead.' "

1Jesus said to his disciples:
"Things that cause people to sin are
bound to come, but woe to that person
through whom they come.
2It would be better for him to be thrown
into the sea with a millstone tied around
his neck than for him to cause one of
these little ones to sin.
3So watch yourselves. "If your brother
sins, rebuke him, and if he repents,
forgive him.
4If he sins against you seven times in a
day, and seven times comes back to
you and says, 'I repent,' forgive him."
5The apostles said to the Lord,
"Increase our faith!"
6He replied, "If you have faith as small
as a mustard seed, you can say to this
mulberry tree, 'Be uprooted and planted
in the sea,' and it will obey you.
7"Suppose one of you had a servant
plowing or looking after the sheep.
Would he say to the servant when he
comes in from the field, 'Come along
now and sit down to eat'?
8Would he not rather say, 'Prepare my
supper, get yourself ready and wait on
me while I eat and drink; after that you
may eat and drink'?
9Would he thank the servant because he
did what he was told to do?
10So you also, when you have done
everything you were told to do, should
say, 'We are unworthy servants; we
have only done our duty.' "
11Now on his way to Jerusalem, Jesus
traveled along the border between
Samaria and Galilee.
12As he was going into a village, ten
men who had leprosy met him. They
stood at a distance
13and called out in a loud voice, "Jesus,
Master, have pity on us!"
14When he saw them, he said, "Go,
show yourselves to the priests." And as
they went, they were cleansed.
15One of them, when he saw he was
healed, came back, praising God in a
loud voice.
16He threw himself at Jesus' feet and
thanked him--and he was a Samaritan.
17Jesus asked, "Were not all ten
cleansed? Where are the other nine?
18Was no one found to return and give
praise to God except this foreigner?"
19Then he said to him, "Rise and go;
your faith has made you well."
20Once, having been asked by the
Pharisees when the kingdom of God
would come, Jesus replied, "The
kingdom of God does not come with
your careful observation,
21nor will people say, 'Here it is,' or
'There it is,' because the kingdom of
God is within you."
22Then he said to his disciples, "The
time is coming when you will long to see
one of the days of the Son of Man, but
you will not see it.
23Men will tell you, 'There he is!' or 'Here
he is!' Do not go running off after them.
24For the Son of Man in his day will be
like the lightning, which flashes and
lights up the sky from one end to the
other.
25But first he must suffer many things
and be rejected by this generation.
26"Just as it was in the days of Noah, so
also will it be in the days of the Son of
Man.
27People were eating, drinking, marrying
and being given in marriage up to the
day Noah entered the ark. Then the
flood came and destroyed them all.
28"It was the same in the days of Lot.
People were eating and drinking, buying
and selling, planting and building.
29But the day Lot left Sodom, fire and
sulfur rained down from heaven and
destroyed them all.
30"It will be just like this on the day the
Son of Man is revealed.
31On that day no one who is on the roof
of his house, with his goods inside,
should go down to get them. Likewise,
no one in the field should go back for
anything.
32Remember Lot's wife!
33Whoever tries to keep his life will lose
it, and whoever loses his life will
preserve it.
34I tell you, on that night two people will
be in one bed; one will be taken and the
other left.
35Two women will be grinding grain
together; one will be taken and the other
left."
37"Where, Lord?" they asked. He replied,
"Where there is a dead body, there the
vultures will gather."

---lk18.1-18.43 { (ch18)
1Then Jesus told his disciples a
parable to show them that they should
always pray and not give up.
2He said: "In a certain town there was a
judge who neither feared God nor cared
about men.
3And there was a widow in that town
who kept coming to him with the plea,
'Grant me justice against my adversary.'
4"For some time he refused. But finally
he said to himself, 'Even though I don't
fear God or care about men,
5yet because this widow keeps
bothering me, I will see that she gets
justice, so that she won't eventually
wear me out with her coming!' "
6And the Lord said, "Listen to what the
unjust judge says.
7And will not God bring about justice for
his chosen ones, who cry out to him day
and night? Will he keep putting them
off?
8I tell you, he will see that they get
justice, and quickly. However, when the
Son of Man comes, will he find faith on
the earth?"
9To some who were confident of their
own righteousness and looked down on
everybody else, Jesus told this parable:
10"Two men went up to the temple to
pray, one a Pharisee and the other a tax
collector.
11The Pharisee stood up and prayed
about himself: 'God, I thank you that I
am not like other men--robbers,
evildoers, adulterers--or even like this
tax collector.
12I fast twice a week and give a tenth of
all I get.'
13"But the tax collector stood at a
distance. He would not even look up to
heaven, but beat his breast and said,
'God, have mercy on me, a sinner.'
14"I tell you that this man, rather than the
other, went home justified before God.
For everyone who exalts himself will be
humbled, and he who humbles himself
will be exalted."
15People were also bringing babies to
Jesus to have him touch them. When
the disciples saw this, they rebuked
them.
16But Jesus called the children to him
and said, "Let the little children come to
me, and do not hinder them, for the
kingdom of God belongs to such as
these.
17I tell you the truth, anyone who will not
receive the kingdom of God like a little
child will never enter it."
18A certain ruler asked him, "Good
teacher, what must I do to inherit eternal
life?"
19"Why do you call me good?" Jesus
answered. "No one is good--except God
alone.
20You know the commandments: 'Do not
commit adultery, do not murder, do not
steal, do not give false testimony, honor
your father and mother.' "
21"All these I have kept since I was a
boy," he said.
22When Jesus heard this, he said to him,
"You still lack one thing. Sell everything
you have and give to the poor, and you
will have treasure in heaven. Then come,
follow me."
23When he heard this, he became very
sad, because he was a man of great
wealth.
24Jesus looked at him and said, "How
hard it is for the rich to enter the
kingdom of God!
25Indeed, it is easier for a camel to go
through the eye of a needle than for a
rich man to enter the kingdom of God."
26Those who heard this asked, "Who
then can be saved?"
27Jesus replied, "What is impossible with
men is possible with God."
28Peter said to him, "We have left all we
had to follow you!"
29"I tell you the truth," Jesus said to them,
"no one who has left home or wife or
brothers or parents or children for the
sake of the kingdom of God
30will fail to receive many times as much
in this age and, in the age to come,
eternal life."
31Jesus took the Twelve aside and told
them, "We are going up to Jerusalem,
and everything that is written by the
prophets about the Son of Man will be
fulfilled.
32He will be handed over to the Gentiles.
They will mock him, insult him, spit on
him, flog him and kill him.
33On the third day he will rise again."
34The disciples did not understand any
of this. Its meaning was hidden from
them, and they did not know what he
was talking about.
35As Jesus approached Jericho, a blind
man was sitting by the roadside begging.
36When he heard the crowd going by, he
asked what was happening.
37They told him, "Jesus of Nazareth is
passing by."
38He called out, "Jesus, Son of David,
have mercy on me!"
39Those who led the way rebuked him
and told him to be quiet, but he shouted
all the more, "Son of David, have mercy
on me!"
40Jesus stopped and ordered the man to
be brought to him. When he came near,
Jesus asked him,
41"What do you want me to do for you?"
"Lord, I want to see," he replied.
42Jesus said to him, "Receive your sight;
your faith has healed you."
43Immediately he received his sight and
followed Jesus, praising God. When all
the people saw it, they also praised God.

1Jesus entered Jericho and was
passing through.
2A man was there by the name of
Zacchaeus; he was a chief tax collector
and was wealthy.
3He wanted to see who Jesus was, but
being a short man he could not,
because of the crowd.
4So he ran ahead and climbed a
sycamore-fig tree to see him, since
Jesus was coming that way.
5When Jesus reached the spot, he
looked up and said to him, "Zacchaeus,
come down immediately. I must stay at
your house today."
6So he came down at once and
welcomed him gladly.
7All the people saw this and began to
mutter, "He has gone to be the guest of
a 'sinner.' "
8But Zacchaeus stood up and said to the
Lord, "Look, Lord! Here and now I give
half of my possessions to the poor, and
if I have cheated anybody out of
anything, I will pay back four times the
amount."
9Jesus said to him, "Today salvation has
come to this house, because this man,
too, is a son of Abraham.
10For the Son of Man came to seek and
to save what was lost."
11While they were listening to this, he
went on to tell them a parable, because
he was near Jerusalem and the people
thought that the kingdom of God was
going to appear at once.
12He said: "A man of noble birth went to
a distant country to have himself
appointed king and then to return.
13So he called ten of his servants and
gave them ten minas. 'Put this money to
work,' he said, 'until I come back.'
14"But his subjects hated him and sent a
delegation after him to say, 'We don't
want this man to be our king.'
15"He was made king, however, and
returned home. Then he sent for the
servants to whom he had given the
money, in order to find out what they
had gained with it.
16"The first one came and said, 'Sir, your
mina has earned ten more.'
17" 'Well done, my good servant!' his
master replied. 'Because you have been
trustworthy in a very small matter, take
charge of ten cities.'
18"The second came and said, 'Sir, your
mina has earned five more.'
19"His master answered, 'You take
charge of five cities.'
20"Then another servant came and said,
'Sir, here is your mina; I have kept it laid
away in a piece of cloth.
21I was afraid of you, because you are a
hard man. You take out what you did not
put in and reap what you did not sow.'
22"His master replied, 'I will judge you by
your own words, you wicked servant!
You knew, did you, that I am a hard man,
taking out what I did not put in, and
reaping what I did not sow?
23Why then didn't you put my money on
deposit, so that when I came back, I
could have collected it with interest?'
24"Then he said to those standing by,
'Take his mina away from him and give
it to the one who has ten minas.'
25" 'Sir,' they said, 'he already has ten!'
26"He replied, 'I tell you that to everyone
who has, more will be given, but as for
the one who has nothing, even what he
has will be taken away.
27But those enemies of mine who did not
want me to be king over them--bring
them here and kill them in front of me.' "
28After Jesus had said this, he went on
ahead, going up to Jerusalem.
29As he approached Bethphage and
Bethany at the hill called the Mount of
Olives, he sent two of his disciples,
saying to them,
30"Go to the village ahead of you, and as
you enter it, you will find a colt tied there,
which no one has ever ridden. Untie it
and bring it here.
31If anyone asks you, 'Why are you
untying it?' tell him, 'The Lord needs it.' "
32Those who were sent ahead went and
found it just as he had told them.
33As they were untying the colt, its
owners asked them, "Why are you
untying the colt?"
34They replied, "The Lord needs it."
35They brought it to Jesus, threw their
cloaks on the colt and put Jesus on it.
36As he went along, people spread their
cloaks on the road.
37When he came near the place where
the road goes down the Mount of Olives,
the whole crowd of disciples began
joyfully to praise God in loud voices for
all the miracles they had seen:
38"Blessed is the king who comes in the
name of the Lord!" "Peace in heaven
and glory in the highest!"
39Some of the Pharisees in the crowd
said to Jesus, "Teacher, rebuke your
disciples!"
40"I tell you," he replied, "if they keep
quiet, the stones will cry out."
41As he approached Jerusalem and saw
the city, he wept over it
42and said, "If you, even you, had only
known on this day what would bring you
peace--but now it is hidden from your
eyes.
43The days will come upon you when
your enemies will build an embankment
against you and encircle you and hem
you in on every side.
44They will dash you to the ground, you
and the children within your walls. They
will not leave one stone on another,
because you did not recognize the time
of God's coming to you."
45Then he entered the temple area and
began driving out those who were
selling.
46"It is written," he said to them, " 'My
house will be a house of prayer' ; but
you have made it 'a den of robbers.' "
47Every day he was teaching at the
temple. But the chief priests, the
teachers of the law and the leaders
among the people were trying to kill him.
48Yet they could not find any way to do it,
because all the people hung on his
words.

---lk20.1-20.47 { (ch20)
1One day as he was teaching the
people in the temple courts and
preaching the gospel, the chief priests
and the teachers of the law, together
with the elders, came up to him.
2"Tell us by what authority you are doing
these things," they said. "Who gave you
this authority?"
3He replied, "I will also ask you a
question. Tell me,
4John's baptism--was it from heaven, or
from men?"
5They discussed it among themselves
and said, "If we say, 'From heaven,' he
will ask, 'Why didn't you believe him?'
6But if we say, 'From men,' all the
people will stone us, because they are
persuaded that John was a prophet."
7So they answered, "We don't know
where it was from."
8Jesus said, "Neither will I tell you by
what authority I am doing these things."
9He went on to tell the people this
parable: "A man planted a vineyard,
rented it to some farmers and went
away for a long time.
10At harvest time he sent a servant to
the tenants so they would give him
some of the fruit of the vineyard. But the
tenants beat him and sent him away
empty-handed.
11He sent another servant, but that one
also they beat and treated shamefully
and sent away empty-handed.
12He sent still a third, and they wounded
him and threw him out.
13"Then the owner of the vineyard said,
'What shall I do? I will send my son,
whom I love; perhaps they will respect
him.'
14"But when the tenants saw him, they
talked the matter over. 'This is the heir,'
they said. 'Let's kill him, and the
inheritance will be ours.'
15So they threw him out of the vineyard
and killed him.
16"What then will the owner of the
vineyard do to them? He will come and
kill those tenants and give the vineyard
to others." When the people heard this,
they said, "May this never be!"
17Jesus looked directly at them and
asked, "Then what is the meaning of
that which is written: " 'The stone the
builders rejected has become the
capstone ' ?
18Everyone who falls on that stone will
be broken to pieces, but he on whom it
falls will be crushed."
19The teachers of the law and the chief
priests looked for a way to arrest him
immediately, because they knew he had
spoken this parable against them. But
they were afraid of the people.
20Keeping a close watch on him, they
sent spies, who pretended to be honest.
They hoped to catch Jesus in something
he said so that they might hand him
over to the power and authority of the
governor.
21So the spies questioned him: "Teacher,
we know that you speak and teach what
is right, and that you do not show
partiality but teach the way of God in
accordance with the truth.
22Is it right for us to pay taxes to Caesar
or not?"
23He saw through their duplicity and said
to them,
24"Show me a denarius. Whose portrait
and inscription are on it?"
25"Caesar's," they replied. He said to
them, "Then give to Caesar what is
Caesar's, and to God what is God's."
26They were unable to trap him in what
he had said there in public. And
astonished by his answer, they became
silent.
27Some of the Sadducees, who say
there is no resurrection, came to Jesus
with a question.
28"Teacher," they said, "Moses wrote for
us that if a man's brother dies and
leaves a wife but no children, the man
must marry the widow and have children
for his brother.
29Now there were seven brothers. The
first one married a woman and died
childless.
30The second
31and then the third married her, and in
the same way the seven died, leaving
no children.
32Finally, the woman died too.
33Now then, at the resurrection whose
wife will she be, since the seven were
married to her?"
34Jesus replied, "The people of this age
marry and are given in marriage.
35But those who are considered worthy
of taking part in that age and in the
resurrection from the dead will neither
marry nor be given in marriage,
36and they can no longer die; for they
are like the angels. They are God's
children, since they are children of the
resurrection.
37But in the account of the bush, even
Moses showed that the dead rise, for he
calls the Lord 'the God of Abraham, and
the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob.'
38He is not the God of the dead, but of
the living, for to him all are alive."
39Some of the teachers of the law
responded, "Well said, teacher!"
40And no one dared to ask him any more
questions.
41Then Jesus said to them, "How is it
that they say the Christ is the Son of
David?
42David himself declares in the Book of
Psalms: " 'The Lord said to my Lord: "Sit
at my right hand
43until I make your enemies a footstool
for your feet." '
44David calls him 'Lord.' How then can
he be his son?"
45While all the people were listening,
Jesus said to his disciples,
46"Beware of the teachers of the law.
They like to walk around in flowing
robes and love to be greeted in the
marketplaces and have the most
important seats in the synagogues and
the places of honor at banquets.
47They devour widows' houses and for a
show make lengthy prayers. Such men
will be punished most severely."

1As he looked up, Jesus saw the
rich putting their gifts into the temple
treasury.
2He also saw a poor widow put in two
very small copper coins.
3"I tell you the truth," he said, "this poor
widow has put in more than all the
others.
4All these people gave their gifts out of
their wealth; but she out of her poverty
put in all she had to live on."
5Some of his disciples were remarking
about how the temple was adorned with
beautiful stones and with gifts dedicated
to God. But Jesus said,
6"As for what you see here, the time will
come when not one stone will be left on
another; every one of them will be
thrown down."
7"Teacher," they asked, "when will these
things happen? And what will be the
sign that they are about to take place?"
8He replied: "Watch out that you are not
deceived. For many will come in my
name, claiming, 'I am he,' and, 'The time
is near.' Do not follow them.
9When you hear of wars and revolutions,
do not be frightened. These things must
happen first, but the end will not come
right away."
10Then he said to them: "Nation will rise
against nation, and kingdom against
kingdom.
11There will be great earthquakes,
famines and pestilences in various
places, and fearful events and great
signs from heaven.
12"But before all this, they will lay hands
on you and persecute you. They will
deliver you to synagogues and prisons,
and you will be brought before kings and
governors, and all on account of my
name.
13This will result in your being witnesses
to them.
14But make up your mind not to worry
beforehand how you will defend
yourselves.
15For I will give you words and wisdom
that none of your adversaries will be
able to resist or contradict.
16You will be betrayed even by parents,
brothers, relatives and friends, and they
will put some of you to death.
17All men will hate you because of me.
18But not a hair of your head will perish.
19By standing firm you will gain life.
20"When you see Jerusalem being
surrounded by armies, you will know
that its desolation is near.
21Then let those who are in Judea flee to
the mountains, let those in the city get
out, and let those in the country not
enter the city.
22For this is the time of punishment in
fulfillment of all that has been written.
23How dreadful it will be in those days
for pregnant women and nursing
mothers! There will be great distress in
the land and wrath against this people.
24They will fall by the sword and will be
taken as prisoners to all the nations.
Jerusalem will be trampled on by the
Gentiles until the times of the Gentiles
are fulfilled.
25"There will be signs in the sun, moon
and stars. On the earth, nations will be
in anguish and perplexity at the roaring
and tossing of the sea.
26Men will faint from terror,
apprehensive of what is coming on the
world, for the heavenly bodies will be
shaken.
27At that time they will see the Son of
Man coming in a cloud with power and
great glory.
28When these things begin to take place,
stand up and lift up your heads,
because your redemption is drawing
near."
29He told them this parable: "Look at the
fig tree and all the trees.
30When they sprout leaves, you can see
for yourselves and know that summer is
near.
31Even so, when you see these things
happening, you know that the kingdom
of God is near.
32"I tell you the truth, this generation will
certainly not pass away until all these
things have happened.
33Heaven and earth will pass away, but
my words will never pass away.
34"Be careful, or your hearts will be
weighed down with dissipation,
drunkenness and the anxieties of life,
and that day will close on you
unexpectedly like a trap.
35For it will come upon all those who live
on the face of the whole earth.
36Be always on the watch, and pray that
you may be able to escape all that is
about to happen, and that you may be
able to stand before the Son of Man."
37Each day Jesus was teaching at the
temple, and each evening he went out
to spend the night on the hill called the
Mount of Olives,
38and all the people came early in the
morning to hear him at the temple.

1Now the Feast of Unleavened
Bread, called the Passover, was
approaching,
2and the chief priests and the teachers
of the law were looking for some way to
get rid of Jesus, for they were afraid of
the people.
3Then Satan entered Judas, called
Iscariot, one of the Twelve.
4And Judas went to the chief priests and
the officers of the temple guard and
discussed with them how he might
betray Jesus.
5They were delighted and agreed to give
him money.
6He consented, and watched for an
opportunity to hand Jesus over to them
when no crowd was present.
7Then came the day of Unleavened
Bread on which the Passover lamb had
to be sacrificed.
8Jesus sent Peter and John, saying, "Go
and make preparations for us to eat the
Passover."
9"Where do you want us to prepare for
it?" they asked.
10He replied, "As you enter the city, a
man carrying a jar of water will meet you.
Follow him to the house that he enters,
11and say to the owner of the house,
'The Teacher asks: Where is the guest
room, where I may eat the Passover
with my disciples?'
12He will show you a large upper room,
all furnished. Make preparations there."
13They left and found things just as
Jesus had told them. So they prepared
the Passover.
14When the hour came, Jesus and his
apostles reclined at the table.
15And he said to them, "I have eagerly
desired to eat this Passover with you
before I suffer.
16For I tell you, I will not eat it again until
it finds fulfillment in the kingdom of
God."
17After taking the cup, he gave thanks
and said, "Take this and divide it among
you.
18For I tell you I will not drink again of
the fruit of the vine until the kingdom of
God comes."
19And he took bread, gave thanks and
broke it, and gave it to them, saying,
"This is my body given for you; do this in
remembrance of me."
20In the same way, after the supper he
took the cup, saying, "This cup is the
new covenant in my blood, which is
poured out for you.
21But the hand of him who is going to
betray me is with mine on the table.
22The Son of Man will go as it has been
decreed, but woe to that man who
betrays him."
23They began to question among
themselves which of them it might be
who would do this.
24Also a dispute arose among them as
to which of them was considered to be
greatest.
25Jesus said to them, "The kings of the
Gentiles lord it over them; and those
who exercise authority over them call
themselves Benefactors.
26But you are not to be like that. Instead,
the greatest among you should be like
the youngest, and the one who rules like
the one who serves.
27For who is greater, the one who is at
the table or the one who serves? Is it
not the one who is at the table? But I am
among you as one who serves.
28You are those who have stood by me
in my trials.
29And I confer on you a kingdom, just as
my Father conferred one on me,
30so that you may eat and drink at my
table in my kingdom and sit on thrones,
judging the twelve tribes of Israel.
31"Simon, Simon, Satan has asked to sift
you as wheat.
32But I have prayed for you, Simon, that
your faith may not fail. And when you
have turned back, strengthen your
brothers."
33But he replied, "Lord, I am ready to go
with you to prison and to death."
34Jesus answered, "I tell you, Peter,
before the rooster crows today, you will
deny three times that you know me."
35Then Jesus asked them, "When I sent
you without purse, bag or sandals, did
you lack anything?" "Nothing," they
answered.
36He said to them, "But now if you have
a purse, take it, and also a bag; and if
you don't have a sword, sell your cloak
and buy one.
37It is written: 'And he was numbered
with the transgressors' ; and I tell you
that this must be fulfilled in me. Yes,
what is written about me is reaching its
fulfillment."
38The disciples said, "See, Lord, here
are two swords." "That is enough," he
replied.
39Jesus went out as usual to the Mount
of Olives, and his disciples followed him.
40On reaching the place, he said to them,
"Pray that you will not fall into
temptation."
41He withdrew about a stone's throw
beyond them, knelt down and prayed,
42"Father, if you are willing, take this cup
from me; yet not my will, but yours be
done."
43An angel from heaven appeared to
him and strengthened him.
44And being in anguish, he prayed more
earnestly, and his sweat was like drops
of blood falling to the ground.
45When he rose from prayer and went
back to the disciples, he found them
asleep, exhausted from sorrow.
46"Why are you sleeping?" he asked
them. "Get up and pray so that you will
not fall into temptation."
47While he was still speaking a crowd
came up, and the man who was called
Judas, one of the Twelve, was leading
them. He approached Jesus to kiss him,
48but Jesus asked him, "Judas, are you
betraying the Son of Man with a kiss?"
49When Jesus' followers saw what was
going to happen, they said, "Lord,
should we strike with our swords?"
50And one of them struck the servant of
the high priest, cutting off his right ear.
51But Jesus answered, "No more of
this!" And he touched the man's ear and
healed him.
52Then Jesus said to the chief priests,
the officers of the temple guard, and the
elders, who had come for him, "Am I
leading a rebellion, that you have come
with swords and clubs?
53Every day I was with you in the temple
courts, and you did not lay a hand on
me. But this is your hour--when
darkness reigns."
54Then seizing him, they led him away
and took him into the house of the high
priest. Peter followed at a distance.
55But when they had kindled a fire in the
middle of the courtyard and had sat
down together, Peter sat down with
them.
56A servant girl saw him seated there in
the firelight. She looked closely at him
and said, "This man was with him."
57But he denied it. "Woman, I don't know
him," he said.
58A little later someone else saw him
and said, "You also are one of them."
"Man, I am not!" Peter replied.
59About an hour later another asserted,
"Certainly this fellow was with him, for
he is a Galilean."
60Peter replied, "Man, I don't know what
you're talking about!" Just as he was
speaking, the rooster crowed.
61The Lord turned and looked straight at
Peter. Then Peter remembered the word
the Lord had spoken to him: "Before the
rooster crows today, you will disown me
three times."
62And he went outside and wept bitterly.
63The men who were guarding Jesus
began mocking and beating him.
64They blindfolded him and demanded,
"Prophesy! Who hit you?"
65And they said many other insulting
things to him.
66At daybreak the council of the elders
of the people, both the chief priests and
teachers of the law, met together, and
Jesus was led before them.
67"If you are the Christ, " they said, "tell
us."
68Jesus answered, "If I tell you, you will
not believe me, and if I asked you, you
would not answer.
69But from now on, the Son of Man will
be seated at the right hand of the mighty
God."
70They all asked, "Are you then the Son
of God?" He replied, "You are right in
saying I am."
71Then they said, "Why do we need any
more testimony? We have heard it from
his own lips."

1Then the whole assembly rose
and led him off to Pilate.
2And they began to accuse him, saying,
"We have found this man subverting our
nation. He opposes payment of taxes to
Caesar and claims to be Christ, a king."
3So Pilate asked Jesus, "Are you the
king of the Jews?" "Yes, it is as you
say," Jesus replied.
4Then Pilate announced to the chief
priests and the crowd, "I find no basis
for a charge against this man."
5But they insisted, "He stirs up the
people all over Judea by his teaching.
He started in Galilee and has come all
the way here."
6On hearing this, Pilate asked if the man
was a Galilean.
7When he learned that Jesus was under
Herod's jurisdiction, he sent him to
Herod, who was also in Jerusalem at
that time.
8When Herod saw Jesus, he was greatly
pleased, because for a long time he had
been wanting to see him. From what he
had heard about him, he hoped to see
him perform some miracle.
9He plied him with many questions, but
Jesus gave him no answer.
10The chief priests and the teachers of
the law were standing there, vehemently
accusing him.
11Then Herod and his soldiers ridiculed
and mocked him. Dressing him in an
elegant robe, they sent him back to
Pilate.
12That day Herod and Pilate became
friends--before this they had been
enemies.
13Pilate called together the chief priests,
the rulers and the people,
14and said to them, "You brought me this
man as one who was inciting the people
to rebellion. I have examined him in your
presence and have found no basis for
your charges against him.
15Neither has Herod, for he sent him
back to us; as you can see, he has done
nothing to deserve death.
16Therefore, I will punish him and then
release him."
18With one voice they cried out, "Away
with this man! Release Barabbas to us!"
19(Barabbas had been thrown into prison
for an insurrection in the city, and for
murder.)
20Wanting to release Jesus, Pilate
appealed to them again.
21But they kept shouting, "Crucify him!
Crucify him!"
22For the third time he spoke to them:
"Why? What crime has this man
committed? I have found in him no
grounds for the death penalty. Therefore
I will have him punished and then
release him."
23But with loud shouts they insistently
demanded that he be crucified, and their
shouts prevailed.
24So Pilate decided to grant their
demand.
25He released the man who had been
thrown into prison for insurrection and
murder, the one they asked for, and
surrendered Jesus to their will.
26As they led him away, they seized
Simon from Cyrene, who was on his
way in from the country, and put the
cross on him and made him carry it
behind Jesus.
27A large number of people followed him,
including women who mourned and
wailed for him.
28Jesus turned and said to them,
"Daughters of Jerusalem, do not weep
for me; weep for yourselves and for your
children.
29For the time will come when you will
say, 'Blessed are the barren women, the
wombs that never bore and the breasts
that never nursed!'
30Then " 'they will say to the mountains,
"Fall on us!" and to the hills, "Cover us!"
'
31For if men do these things when the
tree is green, what will happen when it is
dry?"
32Two other men, both criminals, were
also led out with him to be executed.
33When they came to the place called
the Skull, there they crucified him, along
with the criminals--one on his right, the
other on his left.
34Jesus said, "Father, forgive them, for
they do not know what they are doing."
And they divided up his clothes by
casting lots.
35The people stood watching, and the
rulers even sneered at him. They said,
"He saved others; let him save himself if
he is the Christ of God, the Chosen
One."
36The soldiers also came up and
mocked him. They offered him wine
vinegar
37and said, "If you are the king of the
Jews, save yourself."
38There was a written notice above him,
which read:
39One of the criminals who hung there
hurled insults at him: "Aren't you the
Christ? Save yourself and us!"
40But the other criminal rebuked him.
"Don't you fear God," he said, "since you
are under the same sentence?
41We are punished justly, for we are
getting what our deeds deserve. But this
man has done nothing wrong."
42Then he said, "Jesus, remember me
when you come into your kingdom. "
43Jesus answered him, "I tell you the
truth, today you will be with me in
paradise."
44It was now about the sixth hour, and
darkness came over the whole land until
the ninth hour,
45for the sun stopped shining. And the
curtain of the temple was torn in two.
46Jesus called out with a loud voice,
"Father, into your hands I commit my
spirit." When he had said this, he
breathed his last.
47The centurion, seeing what had
happened, praised God and said,
"Surely this was a righteous man."
48When all the people who had gathered
to witness this sight saw what took place,
they beat their breasts and went away.
49But all those who knew him, including
the women who had followed him from
Galilee, stood at a distance, watching
these things.
50Now there was a man named Joseph,
a member of the Council, a good and
upright man,
51who had not consented to their
decision and action. He came from the
Judean town of Arimathea and he was
waiting for the kingdom of God.
52Going to Pilate, he asked for Jesus'
body.
53Then he took it down, wrapped it in
linen cloth and placed it in a tomb cut in
the rock, one in which no one had yet
been laid.
54It was Preparation Day, and the
Sabbath was about to begin.
55The women who had come with Jesus
from Galilee followed Joseph and saw
the tomb and how his body was laid in it.
56Then they went home and prepared
spices and perfumes. But they rested on
the Sabbath in obedience to the
commandment.
}

#24

---lk24.1-24.53 { (ch24)
1On the first day of the week, very
early in the morning, the women took
the spices they had prepared and went
to the tomb.
2They found the stone rolled away from
the tomb,
3but when they entered, they did not find
the body of the Lord Jesus.
4While they were wondering about this,
suddenly two men in clothes that
gleamed like lightning stood beside
them.
5In their fright the women bowed down
with their faces to the ground, but the
men said to them, "Why do you look for
the living among the dead?
6He is not here; he has risen!
Remember how he told you, while he
was still with you in Galilee:
7'The Son of Man must be delivered into
the hands of sinful men, be crucified and
on the third day be raised again.' "
8Then they remembered his words.
9When they came back from the tomb,
they told all these things to the Eleven
and to all the others.
10It was Mary Magdalene, Joanna, Mary
the mother of James, and the others
with them who told this to the apostles.
11But they did not believe the women,
because their words seemed to them
like nonsense.
12Peter, however, got up and ran to the
tomb. Bending over, he saw the strips of
linen lying by themselves, and he went
away, wondering to himself what had
happened.
13Now that same day two of them were
going to a village called Emmaus, about
seven miles from Jerusalem.
14They were talking with each other
about everything that had happened.
15As they talked and discussed these
things with each other, Jesus himself
came up and walked along with them;
16but they were kept from recognizing
him.
17He asked them, "What are you
discussing together as you walk along?"
18They stood still, their faces downcast.
One of them, named Cleopas, asked
him, "Are you only a visitor to Jerusalem
and do not know the things that have
happened there in these days?"
19"What things?" he asked.
20"About Jesus of Nazareth," they
replied. "He was a prophet, powerful in
word and deed before God and all the
people. The chief priests and our rulers
handed him over to be sentenced to
death, and they crucified him;
21but we had hoped that he was the one
who was going to redeem Israel. And
what is more, it is the third day since all
this took place.
22In addition, some of our women
amazed us. They went to the tomb early
this morning
23but didn't find his body. They came
and told us that they had seen a vision
of angels, who said he was alive.
24Then some of our companions went to
the tomb and found it just as the women
had said, but him they did not see."
25He said to them, "How foolish you are,
and how slow of heart to believe all that
the prophets have spoken!
26Did not the Christ have to suffer these
things and then enter his glory?"
27And beginning with Moses and all the
Prophets, he explained to them what
was said in all the Scriptures concerning
himself.
28As they approached the village to
which they were going, Jesus acted as if
he were going farther.
29But they urged him strongly, "Stay with
us, for it is nearly evening; the day is
almost over." So he went in to stay with
them.
30When he was at the table with them,
he took bread, gave thanks, broke it and
began to give it to them.
31Then their eyes were opened and they
recognized him, and he disappeared
from their sight.
32They asked each other, "Were not our
hearts burning within us while he talked
with us on the road and opened the
Scriptures to us?"
33They got up and returned at once to
Jerusalem. There they found the Eleven
and those with them, assembled
together
34and saying, "It is true! The Lord has
risen and has appeared to Simon."
35Then the two told what had happened
on the way, and how Jesus was
recognized by them when he broke the
bread.
36While they were still talking about this,
Jesus himself stood among them and
said to them, "Peace be with you."
37They were startled and frightened,
thinking they saw a ghost.
38He said to them, "Why are you
troubled, and why do doubts rise in your
minds?
39Look at my hands and my feet. It is I
myself! Touch me and see; a ghost
does not have flesh and bones, as you
see I have."
40When he had said this, he showed
them his hands and feet.
41And while they still did not believe it
because of joy and amazement, he
asked them, "Do you have anything
here to eat?"
42They gave him a piece of broiled fish,
43and he took it and ate it in their
presence.
44He said to them, "This is what I told
you while I was still with you: Everything
must be fulfilled that is written about me
in the Law of Moses, the Prophets and
the Psalms."
45Then he opened their minds so they
could understand the Scriptures.
46He told them, "This is what is written:
The Christ will suffer and rise from the
dead on the third day,
47and repentance and forgiveness of
sins will be preached in his name to all
nations, beginning at Jerusalem.
48You are witnesses of these things.
49I am going to send you what my
Father has promised; but stay in the city
until you have been clothed with power
from on high."
50When he had led them out to the
vicinity of Bethany, he lifted up his
hands and blessed them.
51While he was blessing them, he left
them and was taken up into heaven.
52Then they worshiped him and returned
to Jerusalem with great joy.
53And they stayed continually at the
temple, praising God.

---jn1.1-1.51{ (ch1)
1In the beginning was the Word, and
the Word was with God, and the Word
was God.
2He was with God in the beginning.
3Through him all things were made;
without him nothing was made that has
been made.
4In him was life, and that life was the
light of men.
5The light shines in the darkness, but
the darkness has not understood it.
6There came a man who was sent from
God; his name was John.
7He came as a witness to testify
concerning that light, so that through
him all men might believe.
8He himself was not the light; he came
only as a witness to the light.
9The true light that gives light to every
man was coming into the world.
10He was in the world, and though the
world was made through him, the world
did not recognize him.
11He came to that which was his own,
but his own did not receive him.
12Yet to all who received him, to those
who believed in his name, he gave the
right to become children of God--
13children born not of natural descent,
nor of human decision or a husband's
will, but born of God.
14The Word became flesh and made his
dwelling among us. We have seen his
glory, the glory of the One and Only,
who came from the Father, full of grace
and truth.
15John testifies concerning him. He cries
out, saying, "This was he of whom I said,
'He who comes after me has surpassed
me because he was before me.' "
16From the fullness of his grace we have
all received one blessing after another.
17For the law was given through Moses;
grace and truth came through Jesus
Christ.
18No one has ever seen God, but God
the One and Only, , who is at the
Father's side, has made him known.
19Now this was John's testimony when
the Jews of Jerusalem sent priests and
Levites to ask him who he was.
20He did not fail to confess, but
confessed freely, "I am not the Christ. "
21They asked him, "Then who are you?
Are you Elijah?" He said, "I am not."
"Are you the Prophet?" He answered,
"No."
22Finally they said, "Who are you? Give
us an answer to take back to those who
sent us. What do you say about
yourself?"
23John replied in the words of Isaiah the
prophet, "I am the voice of one calling in
the desert, 'Make straight the way for
the Lord.' "
24Now some Pharisees who had been
sent
25questioned him, "Why then do you
baptize if you are not the Christ, nor
Elijah, nor the Prophet?"
26"I baptize with water," John replied,
"but among you stands one you do not
know.
27He is the one who comes after me, the
thongs of whose sandals I am not
worthy to untie."
28This all happened at Bethany on the
other side of the Jordan, where John
was baptizing.
29The next day John saw Jesus coming
toward him and said, "Look, the Lamb of
God, who takes away the sin of the
world!
30This is the one I meant when I said, 'A
man who comes after me has
surpassed me because he was before
me.'
31I myself did not know him, but the
reason I came baptizing with water was
that he might be revealed to Israel."
32Then John gave this testimony: "I saw
the Spirit come down from heaven as a
dove and remain on him.
33I would not have known him, except
that the one who sent me to baptize with
water told me, 'The man on whom you
see the Spirit come down and remain is
he who will baptize with the Holy Spirit.'
34I have seen and I testify that this is the
Son of God."
35The next day John was there again
with two of his disciples.
36When he saw Jesus passing by, he
said, "Look, the Lamb of God!"
37When the two disciples heard him say
this, they followed Jesus.
38Turning around, Jesus saw them
following and asked, "What do you
want?" They said, "Rabbi" (which means
Teacher), "where are you staying?"
39"Come," he replied, "and you will see."
So they went and saw where he was
staying, and spent that day with him. It
was about the tenth hour.
40Andrew, Simon Peter's brother, was
one of the two who heard what John
had said and who had followed Jesus.
41The first thing Andrew did was to find
his brother Simon and tell him, "We
have found the Messiah" (that is, the
Christ).
42And he brought him to Jesus. Jesus
looked at him and said, "You are Simon
son of John. You will be called Cephas"
(which, when translated, is Peter ).
43The next day Jesus decided to leave
for Galilee. Finding Philip, he said to him,
"Follow me."
44Philip, like Andrew and Peter, was
from the town of Bethsaida.
45Philip found Nathanael and told him,
"We have found the one Moses wrote
about in the Law, and about whom the
prophets also wrote--Jesus of Nazareth,
the son of Joseph."
46"Nazareth! Can anything good come
from there?" Nathanael asked. "Come
and see," said Philip.
47When Jesus saw Nathanael
approaching, he said of him, "Here is a
true Israelite, in whom there is nothing
false."
48"How do you know me?" Nathanael
asked. Jesus answered, "I saw you
while you were still under the fig tree
before Philip called you."
49Then Nathanael declared, "Rabbi, you
are the Son of God; you are the King of
Israel."
50Jesus said, "You believe because I
told you I saw you under the fig tree.
You shall see greater things than that."
51He then added, "I tell you the truth,
you shall see heaven open, and the
angels of God ascending and
descending on the Son of Man."

1On the third day a wedding took
place at Cana in Galilee. Jesus' mother
was there,
2and Jesus and his disciples had also
been invited to the wedding.
3When the wine was gone, Jesus'
mother said to him, "They have no more
wine."
4"Dear woman, why do you involve me?"
Jesus replied, "My time has not yet
come."
5His mother said to the servants, "Do
whatever he tells you."
6Nearby stood six stone water jars, the
kind used by the Jews for ceremonial
washing, each holding from twenty to
thirty gallons.
7Jesus said to the servants, "Fill the jars
with water"; so they filled them to the
brim.
8Then he told them, "Now draw some
out and take it to the master of the
banquet."
9They did so, and the master of the
banquet tasted the water that had been
turned into wine. He did not realize
where it had come from, though the
servants who had drawn the water knew.
Then he called the bridegroom aside
10and said, "Everyone brings out the
choice wine first and then the cheaper
wine after the guests have had too
much to drink; but you have saved the
best till now."
11This, the first of his miraculous signs,
Jesus performed in Cana of Galilee. He
thus revealed his glory, and his disciples
put their faith in him.
12After this he went down to Capernaum
with his mother and brothers and his
disciples. There they stayed for a few
days.
13When it was almost time for the
Jewish Passover, Jesus went up to
Jerusalem.
14In the temple courts he found men
selling cattle, sheep and doves, and
others sitting at tables exchanging
money.
15So he made a whip out of cords, and
drove all from the temple area, both
sheep and cattle; he scattered the coins
of the money changers and overturned
their tables.
16To those who sold doves he said, "Get
these out of here! How dare you turn my
Father's house into a market!"
17His disciples remembered that it is
written: "Zeal for your house will
consume me."
18Then the Jews demanded of him,
"What miraculous sign can you show us
to prove your authority to do all this?"
19Jesus answered them, "Destroy this
temple, and I will raise it again in three
days."
20The Jews replied, "It has taken fortysix
years to build this temple, and you
are going to raise it in three days?"
21But the temple he had spoken of was
his body.
22After he was raised from the dead, his
disciples recalled what he had said.
Then they believed the Scripture and
the words that Jesus had spoken.
23Now while he was in Jerusalem at the
Passover Feast, many people saw the
miraculous signs he was doing and
believed in his name.
24But Jesus would not entrust himself to
them, for he knew all men.
25He did not need man's testimony
about man, for he knew what was in a
man.

---jn3.1-3.36{ (ch3)
1Now there was a man of the
Pharisees named Nicodemus, a
member of the Jewish ruling council.
2He came to Jesus at night and said,
"Rabbi, we know you are a teacher who
has come from God. For no one could
perform the miraculous signs you are
doing if God were not with him."
3In reply Jesus declared, "I tell you the
truth, no one can see the kingdom of
God unless he is born again. "
4"How can a man be born when he is
old?" Nicodemus asked. "Surely he
cannot enter a second time into his
mother's womb to be born!"
5Jesus answered, "I tell you the truth, no
one can enter the kingdom of God
unless he is born of water and the Spirit.
6Flesh gives birth to flesh, but the Spirit
gives birth to spirit.
7You should not be surprised at my
saying, 'You must be born again.'
8The wind blows wherever it pleases.
You hear its sound, but you cannot tell
where it comes from or where it is going.
So it is with everyone born of the Spirit."
9"How can this be?" Nicodemus asked.
10"You are Israel's teacher," said Jesus,
"and do you not understand these
things?
11I tell you the truth, we speak of what
we know, and we testify to what we
have seen, but still you people do not
accept our testimony.
12I have spoken to you of earthly things
and you do not believe; how then will
you believe if I speak of heavenly
things?
13No one has ever gone into heaven
except the one who came from heaven--
the Son of Man.
14Just as Moses lifted up the snake in
the desert, so the Son of Man must be
lifted up,
15that everyone who believes in him may
have eternal life.
16"For God so loved the world that he
gave his one and only Son, that
whoever believes in him shall not perish
but have eternal life.
17For God did not send his Son into the
world to condemn the world, but to save
the world through him.
18Whoever believes in him is not
condemned, but whoever does not
believe stands condemned already
because he has not believed in the
name of God's one and only Son.
19This is the verdict: Light has come into
the world, but men loved darkness
instead of light because their deeds
were evil.
20Everyone who does evil hates the light,
and will not come into the light for fear
that his deeds will be exposed.
21But whoever lives by the truth comes
into the light, so that it may be seen
plainly that what he has done has been
done through God."
22After this, Jesus and his disciples went
out into the Judean countryside, where
he spent some time with them, and
baptized.
23Now John also was baptizing at Aenon
near Salim, because there was plenty of
water, and people were constantly
coming to be baptized.
24(This was before John was put in
prison.)
25An argument developed between
some of John's disciples and a certain
Jew over the matter of ceremonial
washing.
26They came to John and said to him,
"Rabbi, that man who was with you on
the other side of the Jordan--the one
you testified about--well, he is baptizing,
and everyone is going to him."
27To this John replied, "A man can
receive only what is given him from
heaven.
28You yourselves can testify that I said, 'I
am not the Christ but am sent ahead of
him.'
29The bride belongs to the bridegroom.
The friend who attends the bridegroom
waits and listens for him, and is full of
joy when he hears the bridegroom's
voice. That joy is mine, and it is now
complete.
30He must become greater; I must
become less.
31"The one who comes from above is
above all; the one who is from the earth
belongs to the earth, and speaks as one
from the earth. The one who comes
from heaven is above all.
32He testifies to what he has seen and
heard, but no one accepts his testimony.
33The man who has accepted it has
certified that God is truthful.
34For the one whom God has sent
speaks the words of God, for God gives
the Spirit without limit.
35The Father loves the Son and has
placed everything in his hands.
36Whoever believes in the Son has
eternal life, but whoever rejects the Son
will not see life, for God's wrath remains
on him."

1The Pharisees heard that Jesus was
gaining and baptizing more disciples
than John,
2although in fact it was not Jesus who
baptized, but his disciples.
3When the Lord learned of this, he left
Judea and went back once more to
Galilee.
4Now he had to go through Samaria.
5So he came to a town in Samaria called
Sychar, near the plot of ground Jacob
had given to his son Joseph.
6Jacob's well was there, and Jesus, tired
as he was from the journey, sat down by
the well. It was about the sixth hour.
7When a Samaritan woman came to
draw water, Jesus said to her, "Will you
give me a drink?"
8(His disciples had gone into the town to
buy food.)
9The Samaritan woman said to him,
"You are a Jew and I am a Samaritan
woman. How can you ask me for a
drink?" (For Jews do not associate with
Samaritans. )
10Jesus answered her, "If you knew the
gift of God and who it is that asks you
for a drink, you would have asked him
and he would have given you living
water."
11"Sir," the woman said, "you have
nothing to draw with and the well is
deep. Where can you get this living
water?
12Are you greater than our father Jacob,
who gave us the well and drank from it
himself, as did also his sons and his
flocks and herds?"
13Jesus answered, "Everyone who
drinks this water will be thirsty again,
14but whoever drinks the water I give
him will never thirst. Indeed, the water I
give him will become in him a spring of
water welling up to eternal life."
15The woman said to him, "Sir, give me
this water so that I won't get thirsty and
have to keep coming here to draw
water."
16He told her, "Go, call your husband
and come back."
17"I have no husband," she replied.
18Jesus said to her, "You are right when
you say you have no husband. The fact
is, you have had five husbands, and the
man you now have is not your husband.
What you have just said is quite true."
19"Sir," the woman said, "I can see that
you are a prophet.
20Our fathers worshiped on this
mountain, but you Jews claim that the
place where we must worship is in
Jerusalem."
21Jesus declared, "Believe me, woman,
a time is coming when you will worship
the Father neither on this mountain nor
in Jerusalem.
22You Samaritans worship what you do
not know; we worship what we do know,
for salvation is from the Jews.
23Yet a time is coming and has now
come when the true worshipers will
worship the Father in spirit and truth, for
they are the kind of worshipers the
Father seeks.
24God is spirit, and his worshipers must
worship in spirit and in truth."
25The woman said, "I know that
Messiah" (called Christ) "is coming.
When he comes, he will explain
everything to us."
26Then Jesus declared, "I who speak to
you am he."
27Just then his disciples returned and
were surprised to find him talking with a
woman. But no one asked, "What do
you want?" or "Why are you talking with
her?"
28Then, leaving her water jar, the
woman went back to the town and said
to the people,
29"Come, see a man who told me
everything I ever did. Could this be the
Christ ?"
30They came out of the town and made
their way toward him.
31Meanwhile his disciples urged him,
"Rabbi, eat something."
32But he said to them, "I have food to eat
that you know nothing about."
33Then his disciples said to each other,
"Could someone have brought him
food?"
34"My food," said Jesus, "is to do the will
of him who sent me and to finish his
work.
35Do you not say, 'Four months more
and then the harvest'? I tell you, open
your eyes and look at the fields! They
are ripe for harvest.
36Even now the reaper draws his wages,
even now he harvests the crop for
eternal life, so that the sower and the
reaper may be glad together.
37Thus the saying 'One sows and
another reaps' is true.
38I sent you to reap what you have not
worked for. Others have done the hard
work, and you have reaped the benefits
of their labor."
39Many of the Samaritans from that town
believed in him because of the woman's
testimony, "He told me everything I ever
did."
40So when the Samaritans came to him,
they urged him to stay with them, and
he stayed two days.
41And because of his words many more
became believers.
42They said to the woman, "We no
longer believe just because of what you
said; now we have heard for ourselves,
and we know that this man really is the
Savior of the world."
43After the two days he left for Galilee.
44(Now Jesus himself had pointed out
that a prophet has no honor in his own
country.)
45When he arrived in Galilee, the
Galileans welcomed him. They had
seen all that he had done in Jerusalem
at the Passover Feast, for they also had
been there.
46Once more he visited Cana in Galilee,
where he had turned the water into wine.
And there was a certain royal official
whose son lay sick at Capernaum.
47When this man heard that Jesus had
arrived in Galilee from Judea, he went to
him and begged him to come and heal
his son, who was close to death.
48"Unless you people see miraculous
signs and wonders," Jesus told him,
"you will never believe."
49The royal official said, "Sir, come down
before my child dies."
50Jesus replied, "You may go. Your son
will live." The man took Jesus at his
word and departed.
51While he was still on the way, his
servants met him with the news that his
boy was living.
52When he inquired as to the time when
his son got better, they said to him, "The
fever left him yesterday at the seventh
hour."
53Then the father realized that this was
the exact time at which Jesus had said
to him, "Your son will live." So he and all
his household believed.
54This was the second miraculous sign
that Jesus performed, having come from
Judea to Galilee.
}

---jn5.1-5.47{ (ch5)
1Some time later, Jesus went up to
Jerusalem for a feast of the Jews.
2Now there is in Jerusalem near the
Sheep Gate a pool, which in Aramaic is
called Bethesda and which is
surrounded by five covered colonnades.
3Here a great number of disabled people
used to lie--the blind, the lame, the
paralyzed.
5One who was there had been an invalid
for thirty-eight years.
6When Jesus saw him lying there and
learned that he had been in this
condition for a long time, he asked him,
"Do you want to get well?"
7"Sir," the invalid replied, "I have no one
to help me into the pool when the water
is stirred. While I am trying to get in,
someone else goes down ahead of me."
8Then Jesus said to him, "Get up! Pick
up your mat and walk."
9At once the man was cured; he picked
up his mat and walked. The day on
which this took place was a Sabbath,
10and so the Jews said to the man who
had been healed, "It is the Sabbath; the
law forbids you to carry your mat."
11But he replied, "The man who made
me well said to me, 'Pick up your mat
and walk.' "
12So they asked him, "Who is this fellow
who told you to pick it up and walk?"
13The man who was healed had no idea
who it was, for Jesus had slipped away
into the crowd that was there.
14Later Jesus found him at the temple
and said to him, "See, you are well
again. Stop sinning or something worse
may happen to you."
15The man went away and told the Jews
that it was Jesus who had made him
well.
16So, because Jesus was doing these
things on the Sabbath, the Jews
persecuted him.
17Jesus said to them, "My Father is
always at his work to this very day, and I,
too, am working."
18For this reason the Jews tried all the
harder to kill him; not only was he
breaking the Sabbath, but he was even
calling God his own Father, making
himself equal with God.
19Jesus gave them this answer: "I tell
you the truth, the Son can do nothing by
himself; he can do only what he sees his
Father doing, because whatever the
Father does the Son also does.
20For the Father loves the Son and
shows him all he does. Yes, to your
amazement he will show him even
greater things than these.
21For just as the Father raises the dead
and gives them life, even so the Son
gives life to whom he is pleased to give
it.
22Moreover, the Father judges no one,
but has entrusted all judgment to the
Son,
23that all may honor the Son just as they
honor the Father. He who does not
honor the Son does not honor the
Father, who sent him.
24"I tell you the truth, whoever hears my
word and believes him who sent me has
eternal life and will not be condemned;
he has crossed over from death to life.
25I tell you the truth, a time is coming
and has now come when the dead will
hear the voice of the Son of God and
those who hear will live.
26For as the Father has life in himself, so
he has granted the Son to have life in
himself.
27And he has given him authority to
judge because he is the Son of Man.
28"Do not be amazed at this, for a time is
coming when all who are in their graves
will hear his voice
29and come out--those who have done
good will rise to live, and those who
have done evil will rise to be
condemned.
30By myself I can do nothing; I judge
only as I hear, and my judgment is just,
for I seek not to please myself but him
who sent me.
31"If I testify about myself, my testimony
is not valid.
32There is another who testifies in my
favor, and I know that his testimony
about me is valid.
33"You have sent to John and he has
testified to the truth.
34Not that I accept human testimony; but
I mention it that you may be saved.
35John was a lamp that burned and gave
light, and you chose for a time to enjoy
his light.
36"I have testimony weightier than that of
John. For the very work that the Father
has given me to finish, and which I am
doing, testifies that the Father has sent
me.
37And the Father who sent me has
himself testified concerning me. You
have never heard his voice nor seen his
form,
38nor does his word dwell in you, for you
do not believe the one he sent.
39You diligently study the Scriptures
because you think that by them you
possess eternal life. These are the
Scriptures that testify about me,
40yet you refuse to come to me to have
life.
41"I do not accept praise from men,
42but I know you. I know that you do not
have the love of God in your hearts.
43I have come in my Father's name, and
you do not accept me; but if someone
else comes in his own name, you will
accept him.
44How can you believe if you accept
praise from one another, yet make no
effort to obtain the praise that comes
from the only God ?
45"But do not think I will accuse you
before the Father. Your accuser is
Moses, on whom your hopes are set.
46If you believed Moses, you would
believe me, for he wrote about me.
47But since you do not believe what he
wrote, how are you going to believe
what I say?"
}

---jn6.1-6.71{ (ch6)
1Some time after this, Jesus crossed
to the far shore of the Sea of Galilee
(that is, the Sea of Tiberias),
2and a great crowd of people followed
him because they saw the miraculous
signs he had performed on the sick.
3Then Jesus went up on a mountainside
and sat down with his disciples.
4The Jewish Passover Feast was near.
5When Jesus looked up and saw a great
crowd coming toward him, he said to
Philip, "Where shall we buy bread for
these people to eat?"
6He asked this only to test him, for he
already had in mind what he was going
to do.
7Philip answered him, "Eight months'
wages would not buy enough bread for
each one to have a bite!"
8Another of his disciples, Andrew, Simon
Peter's brother, spoke up,
9"Here is a boy with five small barley
loaves and two small fish, but how far
will they go among so many?"
10Jesus said, "Have the people sit
down." There was plenty of grass in that
place, and the men sat down, about five
thousand of them.
11Jesus then took the loaves, gave
thanks, and distributed to those who
were seated as much as they wanted.
He did the same with the fish.
12When they had all had enough to eat,
he said to his disciples, "Gather the
pieces that are left over. Let nothing be
wasted."
13So they gathered them and filled
twelve baskets with the pieces of the
five barley loaves left over by those who
had eaten.
14After the people saw the miraculous
sign that Jesus did, they began to say,
"Surely this is the Prophet who is to
come into the world."
15Jesus, knowing that they intended to
come and make him king by force,
withdrew again to a mountain by himself.
16When evening came, his disciples
went down to the lake,
17where they got into a boat and set off
across the lake for Capernaum. By now
it was dark, and Jesus had not yet
joined them.
18A strong wind was blowing and the
waters grew rough.
19When they had rowed three or three
and a half miles, they saw Jesus
approaching the boat, walking on the
water; and they were terrified.
20But he said to them, "It is I; don't be
afraid."
21Then they were willing to take him into
the boat, and immediately the boat
reached the shore where they were
heading.
22The next day the crowd that had
stayed on the opposite shore of the lake
realized that only one boat had been
there, and that Jesus had not entered it
with his disciples, but that they had gone
away alone.
23Then some boats from Tiberias landed
near the place where the people had
eaten the bread after the Lord had given
thanks.
24Once the crowd realized that neither
Jesus nor his disciples were there, they
got into the boats and went to
Capernaum in search of Jesus.
25When they found him on the other side
of the lake, they asked him, "Rabbi,
when did you get here?"
26Jesus answered, "I tell you the truth,
you are looking for me, not because you
saw miraculous signs but because you
ate the loaves and had your fill.
27Do not work for food that spoils, but for
food that endures to eternal life, which
the Son of Man will give you. On him
God the Father has placed his seal of
approval."
28Then they asked him, "What must we
do to do the works God requires?"
29Jesus answered, "The work of God is
this: to believe in the one he has sent."
30So they asked him, "What miraculous
sign then will you give that we may see
it and believe you? What will you do?
31Our forefathers ate the manna in the
desert; as it is written: 'He gave them
bread from heaven to eat.' "
32Jesus said to them, "I tell you the truth,
it is not Moses who has given you the
bread from heaven, but it is my Father
who gives you the true bread from
heaven.
33For the bread of God is he who comes
down from heaven and gives life to the
world."
34"Sir," they said, "from now on give us
this bread."
35Then Jesus declared, "I am the bread
of life. He who comes to me will never
go hungry, and he who believes in me
will never be thirsty.
36But as I told you, you have seen me
and still you do not believe.
37All that the Father gives me will come
to me, and whoever comes to me I will
never drive away.
38For I have come down from heaven
not to do my will but to do the will of him
who sent me.
39And this is the will of him who sent me,
that I shall lose none of all that he has
given me, but raise them up at the last
day.
40For my Father's will is that everyone
who looks to the Son and believes in
him shall have eternal life, and I will
raise him up at the last day."
41At this the Jews began to grumble
about him because he said, "I am the
bread that came down from heaven."
42They said, "Is this not Jesus, the son
of Joseph, whose father and mother we
know? How can he now say, 'I came
down from heaven'?"
43"Stop grumbling among yourselves,"
Jesus answered.
44"No one can come to me unless the
Father who sent me draws him, and I
will raise him up at the last day.
45It is written in the Prophets: 'They will
all be taught by God.' Everyone who
listens to the Father and learns from him
comes to me.
46No one has seen the Father except
the one who is from God; only he has
seen the Father.
47I tell you the truth, he who believes
has everlasting life.
48I am the bread of life.
49Your forefathers ate the manna in the
desert, yet they died.
50But here is the bread that comes down
from heaven, which a man may eat and
not die.
51I am the living bread that came down
from heaven. If anyone eats of this
bread, he will live forever. This bread is
my flesh, which I will give for the life of
the world."
52Then the Jews began to argue sharply
among themselves, "How can this man
give us his flesh to eat?"
53Jesus said to them, "I tell you the truth,
unless you eat the flesh of the Son of
Man and drink his blood, you have no
life in you.
54Whoever eats my flesh and drinks my
blood has eternal life, and I will raise
him up at the last day.
55For my flesh is real food and my blood
is real drink.
56Whoever eats my flesh and drinks my
blood remains in me, and I in him.
57Just as the living Father sent me and I
live because of the Father, so the one
who feeds on me will live because of me.
58This is the bread that came down from
heaven. Your forefathers ate manna and
died, but he who feeds on this bread will
live forever."
59He said this while teaching in the
synagogue in Capernaum.
60On hearing it, many of his disciples
said, "This is a hard teaching. Who can
accept it?"
61Aware that his disciples were
grumbling about this, Jesus said to them,
"Does this offend you?
62What if you see the Son of Man
ascend to where he was before!
63The Spirit gives life; the flesh counts
for nothing. The words I have spoken to
you are spirit and they are life.
64Yet there are some of you who do not
believe." For Jesus had known from the
beginning which of them did not believe
and who would betray him.
65He went on to say, "This is why I told
you that no one can come to me unless
the Father has enabled him."
66From this time many of his disciples
turned back and no longer followed him.
67"You do not want to leave too, do
you?" Jesus asked the Twelve.
68Simon Peter answered him, "Lord, to
whom shall we go? You have the words
of eternal life.
69We believe and know that you are the
Holy One of God."
70Then Jesus replied, "Have I not
chosen you, the Twelve? Yet one of you
is a devil!"
71(He meant Judas, the son of Simon
Iscariot, who, though one of the Twelve,
was later to betray him.)

---jn7.1-7.53{ (ch7)
1After this, Jesus went around in
Galilee, purposely staying away from
Judea because the Jews there were
waiting to take his life.
2But when the Jewish Feast of
Tabernacles was near,
3Jesus' brothers said to him, "You ought
to leave here and go to Judea, so that
your disciples may see the miracles you
do.
4No one who wants to become a public
figure acts in secret. Since you are
doing these things, show yourself to the
world."
5For even his own brothers did not
believe in him.
6Therefore Jesus told them, "The right
time for me has not yet come; for you
any time is right.
7The world cannot hate you, but it hates
me because I testify that what it does is
evil.
8You go to the Feast. I am not yet going
up to this Feast, because for me the
right time has not yet come."
9Having said this, he stayed in Galilee.
10However, after his brothers had left for
the Feast, he went also, not publicly, but
in secret.
11Now at the Feast the Jews were
watching for him and asking, "Where is
that man?"
12Among the crowds there was
widespread whispering about him.
Some said, "He is a good man."
13Others replied, "No, he deceives the
people." But no one would say anything
publicly about him for fear of the Jews.
14Not until halfway through the Feast did
Jesus go up to the temple courts and
begin to teach.
15The Jews were amazed and asked,
"How did this man get such learning
without having studied?"
16Jesus answered, "My teaching is not
my own. It comes from him who sent me.
17If anyone chooses to do God's will, he
will find out whether my teaching comes
from God or whether I speak on my own.
18He who speaks on his own does so to
gain honor for himself, but he who works
for the honor of the one who sent him is
a man of truth; there is nothing false
about him.
19Has not Moses given you the law? Yet
not one of you keeps the law. Why are
you trying to kill me?"
20"You are demon-possessed," the
crowd answered. "Who is trying to kill
you?"
21Jesus said to them, "I did one miracle,
and you are all astonished.
22Yet, because Moses gave you
circumcision (though actually it did not
come from Moses, but from the
patriarchs), you circumcise a child on
the Sabbath.
23Now if a child can be circumcised on
the Sabbath so that the law of Moses
may not be broken, why are you angry
with me for healing the whole man on
the Sabbath?
24Stop judging by mere appearances,
and make a right judgment."
25At that point some of the people of
Jerusalem began to ask, "Isn't this the
man they are trying to kill?
26Here he is, speaking publicly, and they
are not saying a word to him. Have the
authorities really concluded that he is
the Christ ?
27But we know where this man is from;
when the Christ comes, no one will
know where he is from."
28Then Jesus, still teaching in the temple
courts, cried out, "Yes, you know me,
and you know where I am from. I am not
here on my own, but he who sent me is
true. You do not know him,
29but I know him because I am from him
and he sent me."
30At this they tried to seize him, but no
one laid a hand on him, because his
time had not yet come.
31Still, many in the crowd put their faith
in him. They said, "When the Christ
comes, will he do more miraculous signs
than this man?"
32The Pharisees heard the crowd
whispering such things about him. Then
the chief priests and the Pharisees sent
temple guards to arrest him.
33Jesus said, "I am with you for only a
short time, and then I go to the one who
sent me.
34You will look for me, but you will not
find me; and where I am, you cannot
come."
35The Jews said to one another, "Where
does this man intend to go that we
cannot find him? Will he go where our
people live scattered among the Greeks,
and teach the Greeks?
36What did he mean when he said, 'You
will look for me, but you will not find me,'
and 'Where I am, you cannot come'?"
37On the last and greatest day of the
Feast, Jesus stood and said in a loud
voice, "If anyone is thirsty, let him come
to me and drink.
38Whoever believes in me, as the
Scripture has said, streams of living
water will flow from within him."
39By this he meant the Spirit, whom
those who believed in him were later to
receive. Up to that time the Spirit had
not been given, since Jesus had not yet
been glorified.
40On hearing his words, some of the
people said, "Surely this man is the
Prophet."
41Others said, "He is the Christ."
42Still others asked, "How can the Christ
come from Galilee? Does not the
Scripture say that the Christ will come
from David's family and from Bethlehem,
the town where David lived?"
43Thus the people were divided because
of Jesus.
44Some wanted to seize him, but no one
laid a hand on him.
45Finally the temple guards went back to
the chief priests and Pharisees, who
asked them, "Why didn't you bring him
in?"
46"No one ever spoke the way this man
does," the guards declared.
47"You mean he has deceived you
also?" the Pharisees retorted.
48"Has any of the rulers or of the
Pharisees believed in him?
49No! But this mob that knows nothing of
the law--there is a curse on them."
50Nicodemus, who had gone to Jesus
earlier and who was one of their own
number, asked,
51"Does our law condemn anyone
without first hearing him to find out what
he is doing?"
52They replied, "Are you from Galilee,
too? Look into it, and you will find that a
prophet does not come out of Galilee."
53Then each went to his own home.

---jn8.1-8.59{ (ch8)
1But Jesus went to the Mount of
Olives.
2At dawn he appeared again in the
temple courts, where all the people
gathered around him, and he sat down
to teach them.
3The teachers of the law and the
Pharisees brought in a woman caught in
adultery. They made her stand before
the group
4and said to Jesus, "Teacher, this
woman was caught in the act of adultery.
5In the Law Moses commanded us to
stone such women. Now what do you
say?"
6They were using this question as a trap,
in order to have a basis for accusing him.
7But Jesus bent down and started to
write on the ground with his finger.
When they kept on questioning him, he
straightened up and said to them, "If any
one of you is without sin, let him be the
first to throw a stone at her."
8Again he stooped down and wrote on
the ground.
9At this, those who heard began to go
away one at a time, the older ones first,
until only Jesus was left, with the
woman still standing there.
10Jesus straightened up and asked her,
"Woman, where are they? Has no one
condemned you?"
11"No one, sir," she said. "Then neither
do I condemn you," Jesus declared. "Go
now and leave your life of sin."
12When Jesus spoke again to the people,
he said, "I am the light of the world.
Whoever follows me will never walk in
darkness, but will have the light of life."
13The Pharisees challenged him, "Here
you are, appearing as your own witness;
your testimony is not valid."
14Jesus answered, "Even if I testify on
my own behalf, my testimony is valid, for
I know where I came from and where I
am going. But you have no idea where I
come from or where I am going.
15You judge by human standards; I pass
judgment on no one.
16But if I do judge, my decisions are right,
because I am not alone. I stand with the
Father, who sent me.
17In your own Law it is written that the
testimony of two men is valid.
18I am one who testifies for myself; my
other witness is the Father, who sent
me."
19Then they asked him, "Where is your
father?"
20"You do not know me or my Father,"
Jesus replied. "If you knew me, you
would know my Father also." He spoke
these words while teaching in the
temple area near the place where the
offerings were put. Yet no one seized
him, because his time had not yet come.
21Once more Jesus said to them, "I am
going away, and you will look for me,
and you will die in your sin. Where I go,
you cannot come."
22This made the Jews ask, "Will he kill
himself? Is that why he says, 'Where I
go, you cannot come'?"
23But he continued, "You are from
below; I am from above. You are of this
world; I am not of this world.
24I told you that you would die in your
sins; if you do not believe that I am the
one I claim to be, you will indeed die in
your sins."
25"Who are you?" they asked.
26"Just what I have been claiming all
along," Jesus replied. "I have much to
say in judgment of you. But he who sent
me is reliable, and what I have heard
from him I tell the world."
27They did not understand that he was
telling them about his Father.
28So Jesus said, "When you have lifted
up the Son of Man, then you will know
that I am the one I claim to be and that I
do nothing on my own but speak just
what the Father has taught me.
29The one who sent me is with me; he
has not left me alone, for I always do
what pleases him."
30Even as he spoke, many put their faith
in him.
31To the Jews who had believed him,
Jesus said, "If you hold to my teaching,
you are really my disciples.
32Then you will know the truth, and the
truth will set you free."
33They answered him, "We are
Abraham's descendants and have never
been slaves of anyone. How can you
say that we shall be set free?"
34Jesus replied, "I tell you the truth,
everyone who sins is a slave to sin.
35Now a slave has no permanent place
in the family, but a son belongs to it
forever.
36So if the Son sets you free, you will be
free indeed.
37I know you are Abraham's
descendants. Yet you are ready to kill
me, because you have no room for my
word.
38I am telling you what I have seen in
the Father's presence, and you do what
you have heard from your father. "
39"Abraham is our father," they
answered. "If you were Abraham's
children," said Jesus, "then you would
40do the things Abraham did. As it is,
you are determined to kill me, a man
who has told you the truth that I heard
from God. Abraham did not do such
things.
41You are doing the things your own
father does." "We are not illegitimate
children," they protested. "The only
Father we have is God himself."
42Jesus said to them, "If God were your
Father, you would love me, for I came
from God and now am here. I have not
come on my own; but he sent me.
43Why is my language not clear to you?
Because you are unable to hear what I
say.
44You belong to your father, the devil,
and you want to carry out your father's
desire. He was a murderer from the
beginning, not holding to the truth, for
there is no truth in him. When he lies, he
speaks his native language, for he is a
liar and the father of lies.
45Yet because I tell the truth, you do not
believe me!
46Can any of you prove me guilty of sin?
If I am telling the truth, why don't you
believe me?
47He who belongs to God hears what
God says. The reason you do not hear
is that you do not belong to God."
48The Jews answered him, "Aren't we
right in saying that you are a Samaritan
and demon-possessed?"
49"I am not possessed by a demon," said
Jesus, "but I honor my Father and you
dishonor me.
50I am not seeking glory for myself; but
there is one who seeks it, and he is the
judge.
51I tell you the truth, if anyone keeps my
word, he will never see death."
52At this the Jews exclaimed, "Now we
know that you are demon-possessed!
Abraham died and so did the prophets,
yet you say that if anyone keeps your
word, he will never taste death.
53Are you greater than our father
Abraham? He died, and so did the
prophets. Who do you think you are?"
54Jesus replied, "If I glorify myself, my
glory means nothing. My Father, whom
you claim as your God, is the one who
glorifies me.
55Though you do not know him, I know
him. If I said I did not, I would be a liar
like you, but I do know him and keep his
word.
56Your father Abraham rejoiced at the
thought of seeing my day; he saw it and
was glad."
57"You are not yet fifty years old," the
Jews said to him, "and you have seen
Abraham!"
58"I tell you the truth," Jesus answered,
"before Abraham was born, I am!"
59At this, they picked up stones to stone
him, but Jesus hid himself, slipping
away from the temple grounds.
}

---jn9.1-9.41{ (ch9)
1As he went along, he saw a man
blind from birth.
2His disciples asked him, "Rabbi, who
sinned, this man or his parents, that he
was born blind?"
3"Neither this man nor his parents
sinned," said Jesus, "but this happened
so that the work of God might be
displayed in his life.
4As long as it is day, we must do the
work of him who sent me. Night is
coming, when no one can work.
5While I am in the world, I am the light of
the world."
6Having said this, he spit on the ground,
made some mud with the saliva, and put
it on the man's eyes.
7"Go," he told him, "wash in the Pool of
Siloam" (this word means Sent). So the
man went and washed, and came home
seeing.
8His neighbors and those who had
formerly seen him begging asked, "Isn't
this the same man who used to sit and
beg?"
9Some claimed that he was. Others said,
"No, he only looks like him." But he
himself insisted, "I am the man."
10"How then were your eyes opened?"
they demanded.
11He replied, "The man they call Jesus
made some mud and put it on my eyes.
He told me to go to Siloam and wash.
So I went and washed, and then I could
see."
12"Where is this man?" they asked him.
"I don't know," he said.
13They brought to the Pharisees the
man who had been blind.
14Now the day on which Jesus had
made the mud and opened the man's
eyes was a Sabbath.
15Therefore the Pharisees also asked
him how he had received his sight. "He
put mud on my eyes," the man replied,
"and I washed, and now I see."
16Some of the Pharisees said, "This man
is not from God, for he does not keep
the Sabbath." But others asked, "How
can a sinner do such miraculous signs?"
So they were divided.
17Finally they turned again to the blind
man, "What have you to say about him?
It was your eyes he opened." The man
replied, "He is a prophet."
18The Jews still did not believe that he
had been blind and had received his
sight until they sent for the man's
parents.
19"Is this your son?" they asked. "Is this
the one you say was born blind? How is
it that now he can see?"
20"We know he is our son," the parents
answered, "and we know he was born
blind.
21But how he can see now, or who
opened his eyes, we don't know. Ask
him. He is of age; he will speak for
himself."
22His parents said this because they
were afraid of the Jews, for already the
Jews had decided that anyone who
acknowledged that Jesus was the Christ
would be put out of the synagogue.
23That was why his parents said, "He is
of age; ask him."
24A second time they summoned the
man who had been blind. "Give glory to
God, " they said. "We know this man is a
sinner."
25He replied, "Whether he is a sinner or
not, I don't know. One thing I do know. I
was blind but now I see!"
26Then they asked him, "What did he do
to you? How did he open your eyes?"
27He answered, "I have told you already
and you did not listen. Why do you want
to hear it again? Do you want to become
his disciples, too?"
28Then they hurled insults at him and
said, "You are this fellow's disciple! We
are disciples of Moses!
29We know that God spoke to Moses,
but as for this fellow, we don't even
know where he comes from."
30The man answered, "Now that is
remarkable! You don't know where he
comes from, yet he opened my eyes.
31We know that God does not listen to
sinners. He listens to the godly man who
does his will.
32Nobody has ever heard of opening the
eyes of a man born blind.
33If this man were not from God, he
could do nothing."
34To this they replied, "You were
steeped in sin at birth; how dare you
lecture us!" And they threw him out.
35Jesus heard that they had thrown him
out, and when he found him, he said,
"Do you believe in the Son of Man?"
36"Who is he, sir?" the man asked. "Tell
me so that I may believe in him."
37Jesus said, "You have now seen him;
in fact, he is the one speaking with you."
38Then the man said, "Lord, I believe,"
and he worshiped him.
39Jesus said, "For judgment I have come
into this world, so that the blind will see
and those who see will become blind."
40Some Pharisees who were with him
heard him say this and asked, "What?
Are we blind too?"
41Jesus said, "If you were blind, you
would not be guilty of sin; but now that
you claim you can see, your guilt
remains.
}

---jn10.1-10.42{ (ch10)
1"I tell you the truth, the man who
does not enter the sheep pen by the
gate, but climbs in by some other way,
is a thief and a robber.
2The man who enters by the gate is the
shepherd of his sheep.
3The watchman opens the gate for him,
and the sheep listen to his voice. He
calls his own sheep by name and leads
them out.
4When he has brought out all his own,
he goes on ahead of them, and his
sheep follow him because they know his
voice.
5But they will never follow a stranger; in
fact, they will run away from him
because they do not recognize a
strangers voice."
6Jesus used this figure of speech, but
they did not understand what he was
telling them.
7Therefore Jesus said again, "I tell you
the truth, I am the gate for the sheep.
8All who ever came before me were
thieves and robbers, but the sheep did
not listen to them.
9I am the gate; whoever enters through
me will be saved. He will come in and
go out, and find pasture.
10The thief comes only to steal and kill
and destroy; I have come that they may
have life, and have it to the full.
11"I am the good shepherd. The good
shepherd lays down his life for the
sheep.
12The hired hand is not the shepherd
who owns the sheep. So when he sees
the wolf coming, he abandons the sheep
and runs away. Then the wolf attacks
the flock and scatters it.
13The man runs away because he is a
hired hand and cares nothing for the
sheep.
14"I am the good shepherd; I know my
sheep and my sheep know me--
15just as the Father knows me and I
know the Father--and I lay down my life
for the sheep.
16I have other sheep that are not of this
sheep pen. I must bring them also. They
too will listen to my voice, and there
shall be one flock and one shepherd.
17The reason my Father loves me is that
I lay down my life--only to take it up
again.
18No one takes it from me, but I lay it
down of my own accord. I have authority
to lay it down and authority to take it up
again. This command I received from
my Father."
19At these words the Jews were again
divided.
20Many of them said, "He is demonpossessed
and raving mad. Why listen
to him?"
21But others said, "These are not the
sayings of a man possessed by a
demon. Can a demon open the eyes of
the blind?"
22Then came the Feast of Dedication at
Jerusalem. It was winter,
23and Jesus was in the temple area
walking in Solomon's Colonnade.
24The Jews gathered around him, saying,
"How long will you keep us in
suspense? If you are the Christ, tell us
plainly."
25Jesus answered, "I did tell you, but
you do not believe. The miracles I do in
my Father's name speak for me,
26but you do not believe because you
are not my sheep.
27My sheep listen to my voice; I know
them, and they follow me.
28I give them eternal life, and they shall
never perish; no one can snatch them
out of my hand.
29My Father, who has given them to me,
is greater than all ; no one can snatch
them out of my Father's hand.
30I and the Father are one."
31Again the Jews picked up stones to
stone him,
32but Jesus said to them, "I have shown
you many great miracles from the
Father. For which of these do you stone
me?"
33"We are not stoning you for any of
these," replied the Jews, "but for
blasphemy, because you, a mere man,
claim to be God."
34Jesus answered them, "Is it not written
in your Law, 'I have said you are gods' ?
35If he called them 'gods,' to whom the
word of God came--and the Scripture
cannot be broken--
36what about the one whom the Father
set apart as his very own and sent into
the world? Why then do you accuse me
of blasphemy because I said, 'I am
God's Son'?
37Do not believe me unless I do what my
Father does.
38But if I do it, even though you do not
believe me, believe the miracles, that
you may know and understand that the
Father is in me, and I in the Father."
39Again they tried to seize him, but he
escaped their grasp.
40Then Jesus went back across the
Jordan to the place where John had
been baptizing in the early days. Here
he stayed
41and many people came to him. They
said, "Though John never performed a
miraculous sign, all that John said about
this man was true."
42And in that place many believed in
Jesus.
}

---jn11.1-11.57{ (ch11)
1Now a man named Lazarus was
sick. He was from Bethany, the village
of Mary and her sister Martha.
2This Mary, whose brother Lazarus now
lay sick, was the same one who poured
perfume on the Lord and wiped his feet
with her hair.
3So the sisters sent word to Jesus, "Lord,
the one you love is sick."
4When he heard this, Jesus said, "This
sickness will not end in death. No, it is
for God's glory so that God's Son may
be glorified through it."
5Jesus loved Martha and her sister and
Lazarus.
6Yet when he heard that Lazarus was
sick, he stayed where he was two more
days.
7Then he said to his disciples, "Let us go
back to Judea."
8"But Rabbi," they said, "a short while
ago the Jews tried to stone you, and yet
you are going back there?"
9Jesus answered, "Are there not twelve
hours of daylight? A man who walks by
day will not stumble, for he sees by this
world's light.
10It is when he walks by night that he
stumbles, for he has no light."
11After he had said this, he went on to
tell them, "Our friend Lazarus has fallen
asleep; but I am going there to wake
him up."
12His disciples replied, "Lord, if he
sleeps, he will get better."
13Jesus had been speaking of his death,
but his disciples thought he meant
natural sleep.
14So then he told them plainly, "Lazarus
is dead,
15and for your sake I am glad I was not
there, so that you may believe. But let
us go to him."
16Then Thomas (called Didymus) said to
the rest of the disciples, "Let us also go,
that we may die with him."
17On his arrival, Jesus found that
Lazarus had already been in the tomb
for four days.
18Bethany was less than two miles from
Jerusalem,
19and many Jews had come to Martha
and Mary to comfort them in the loss of
their brother.
20When Martha heard that Jesus was
coming, she went out to meet him, but
Mary stayed at home.
21"Lord," Martha said to Jesus, "if you
had been here, my brother would not
have died.
22But I know that even now God will give
you whatever you ask."
23Jesus said to her, "Your brother will
rise again."
24Martha answered, "I know he will rise
again in the resurrection at the last day."
25Jesus said to her, "I am the
resurrection and the life. He who
believes in me will live, even though he
dies;
26and whoever lives and believes in me
will never die. Do you believe this?"
27"Yes, Lord," she told him, "I believe
that you are the Christ, the Son of God,
who was to come into the world."
28And after she had said this, she went
back and called her sister Mary aside.
"The Teacher is here," she said, "and is
asking for you."
29When Mary heard this, she got up
quickly and went to him.
30Now Jesus had not yet entered the
village, but was still at the place where
Martha had met him.
31When the Jews who had been with
Mary in the house, comforting her,
noticed how quickly she got up and went
out, they followed her, supposing she
was going to the tomb to mourn there.
32When Mary reached the place where
Jesus was and saw him, she fell at his
feet and said, "Lord, if you had been
here, my brother would not have died."
33When Jesus saw her weeping, and the
Jews who had come along with her also
weeping, he was deeply moved in spirit
and troubled.
34"Where have you laid him?" he asked.
"Come and see, Lord," they replied.
35Jesus wept.
36Then the Jews said, "See how he
loved him!"
37But some of them said, "Could not he
who opened the eyes of the blind man
have kept this man from dying?"
38Jesus, once more deeply moved,
came to the tomb. It was a cave with a
stone laid across the entrance.
39"Take away the stone," he said. "But,
Lord," said Martha, the sister of the
dead man, "by this time there is a bad
odor, for he has been there four days."
40Then Jesus said, "Did I not tell you
that if you believed, you would see the
glory of God?"
41So they took away the stone. Then
Jesus looked up and said, "Father, I
thank you that you have heard me.
42I knew that you always hear me, but I
said this for the benefit of the people
standing here, that they may believe
that you sent me."
43When he had said this, Jesus called in
a loud voice, "Lazarus, come out!"
44The dead man came out, his hands
and feet wrapped with strips of linen,
and a cloth around his face. Jesus said
to them, "Take off the grave clothes and
let him go."
45Therefore many of the Jews who had
come to visit Mary, and had seen what
Jesus did, put their faith in him.
46But some of them went to the
Pharisees and told them what Jesus
had done.
47Then the chief priests and the
Pharisees called a meeting of the
Sanhedrin.
48"What are we accomplishing?" they
asked. "Here is this man performing
many miraculous signs. If we let him go
on like this, everyone will believe in him,
and then the Romans will come and
take away both our place and our
nation."
49Then one of them, named Caiaphas,
who was high priest that year, spoke up,
"You know nothing at all!
50You do not realize that it is better for
you that one man die for the people than
that the whole nation perish."
51He did not say this on his own, but as
high priest that year he prophesied that
Jesus would die for the Jewish nation,
52and not only for that nation but also for
the scattered children of God, to bring
them together and make them one.
53So from that day on they plotted to
take his life.
54Therefore Jesus no longer moved
about publicly among the Jews. Instead
he withdrew to a region near the desert,
to a village called Ephraim, where he
stayed with his disciples.
55When it was almost time for the
Jewish Passover, many went up from
the country to Jerusalem for their
ceremonial cleansing before the
Passover.
56They kept looking for Jesus, and as
they stood in the temple area they
asked one another, "What do you think?
Isn't he coming to the Feast at all?"
57But the chief priests and Pharisees
had given orders that if anyone found
out where Jesus was, he should report it
so that they might arrest him.
}

---jn12.1-12.50{ (ch12)
1Six days before the Passover,
Jesus arrived at Bethany, where
Lazarus lived, whom Jesus had raised
from the dead.
2Here a dinner was given in Jesus'
honor. Martha served, while Lazarus
was among those reclining at the table
with him.
3Then Mary took about a pint of pure
nard, an expensive perfume; she poured
it on Jesus' feet and wiped his feet with
her hair. And the house was filled with
the fragrance of the perfume.
4But one of his disciples, Judas Iscariot,
who was later to betray him, objected,
5"Why wasn't this perfume sold and the
money given to the poor? It was worth a
year's wages. "
6He did not say this because he cared
about the poor but because he was a
thief; as keeper of the money bag, he
used to help himself to what was put
into it.
7"Leave her alone," Jesus replied. "It
was intended that she should save this
perfume for the day of my burial.
8You will always have the poor among
you, but you will not always have me."
9Meanwhile a large crowd of Jews found
out that Jesus was there and came, not
only because of him but also to see
Lazarus, whom he had raised from the
dead.
10So the chief priests made plans to kill
Lazarus as well,
11for on account of him many of the
Jews were going over to Jesus and
putting their faith in him.
12The next day the great crowd that had
come for the Feast heard that Jesus
was on his way to Jerusalem.
13They took palm branches and went out
to meet him, shouting, "Hosanna! "
"Blessed is he who comes in the name
of the Lord!" "Blessed is the King of
Israel!"
14Jesus found a young donkey and sat
upon it, as it is written,
15"Do not be afraid, O Daughter of Zion;
see, your king is coming, seated on a
donkey's colt."
16At first his disciples did not understand
all this. Only after Jesus was glorified
did they realize that these things had
been written about him and that they
had done these things to him.
17Now the crowd that was with him when
he called Lazarus from the tomb and
raised him from the dead continued to
spread the word.
18Many people, because they had heard
that he had given this miraculous sign,
went out to meet him.
19So the Pharisees said to one another,
"See, this is getting us nowhere. Look
how the whole world has gone after
him!"
20Now there were some Greeks among
those who went up to worship at the
Feast.
21They came to Philip, who was from
Bethsaida in Galilee, with a request.
"Sir," they said, "we would like to see
Jesus."
22Philip went to tell Andrew; Andrew and
Philip in turn told Jesus.
23Jesus replied, "The hour has come for
the Son of Man to be glorified.
24I tell you the truth, unless a kernel of
wheat falls to the ground and dies, it
remains only a single seed. But if it dies,
it produces many seeds.
25The man who loves his life will lose it,
while the man who hates his life in this
world will keep it for eternal life.
26Whoever serves me must follow me;
and where I am, my servant also will be.
My Father will honor the one who serves
me.
27"Now my heart is troubled, and what
shall I say? 'Father, save me from this
hour'? No, it was for this very reason I
came to this hour.
28Father, glorify your name!"
29Then a voice came from heaven, "I
have glorified it, and will glorify it again."
The crowd that was there and heard it
said it had thundered; others said an
angel had spoken to him.
30Jesus said, "This voice was for your
benefit, not mine.
31Now is the time for judgment on this
world; now the prince of this world will
be driven out.
32But I, when I am lifted up from the
earth, will draw all men to myself."
33He said this to show the kind of death
he was going to die.
34The crowd spoke up, "We have heard
from the Law that the Christ will remain
forever, so how can you say, 'The Son
of Man must be lifted up'? Who is this
'Son of Man'?"
35Then Jesus told them, "You are going
to have the light just a little while longer.
Walk while you have the light, before
darkness overtakes you. The man who
walks in the dark does not know where
he is going.
36Put your trust in the light while you
have it, so that you may become sons of
light." When he had finished speaking,
Jesus left and hid himself from them.
37Even after Jesus had done all these
miraculous signs in their presence, they
still would not believe in him.
38This was to fulfill the word of Isaiah the
prophet: "Lord, who has believed our
message and to whom has the arm of
the Lord been revealed?"
39For this reason they could not believe,
because, as Isaiah says elsewhere:
40"He has blinded their eyes and
deadened their hearts, so they can
neither see with their eyes, nor
understand with their hearts, nor turn--
and I would heal them."
41Isaiah said this because he saw Jesus'
glory and spoke about him.
42Yet at the same time many even
among the leaders believed in him. But
because of the Pharisees they would
not confess their faith for fear they
would be put out of the synagogue;
43for they loved praise from men more
than praise from God.
44Then Jesus cried out, "When a man
believes in me, he does not believe in
me only, but in the one who sent me.
45When he looks at me, he sees the one
who sent me.
46I have come into the world as a light,
so that no one who believes in me
should stay in darkness.
47"As for the person who hears my
words but does not keep them, I do not
judge him. For I did not come to judge
the world, but to save it.
48There is a judge for the one who
rejects me and does not accept my
words; that very word which I spoke will
condemn him at the last day.
49For I did not speak of my own accord,
but the Father who sent me commanded
me what to say and how to say it.
50I know that his command leads to
eternal life. So whatever I say is just
what the Father has told me to say."

---jn13.1-13.38{ (ch13)
1It was just before the Passover
Feast. Jesus knew that the time had
come for him to leave this world and go
to the Father. Having loved his own who
were in the world, he now showed them
the full extent of his love.
2The evening meal was being served,
and the devil had already prompted
Judas Iscariot, son of Simon, to betray
Jesus.
3Jesus knew that the Father had put all
things under his power, and that he had
come from God and was returning to
God;
4so he got up from the meal, took off his
outer clothing, and wrapped a towel
around his waist.
5After that, he poured water into a basin
and began to wash his disciples' feet,
drying them with the towel that was
wrapped around him.
6He came to Simon Peter, who said to
him, "Lord, are you going to wash my
feet?"
7Jesus replied, "You do not realize now
what I am doing, but later you will
understand."
8"No," said Peter, "you shall never wash
my feet." Jesus answered, "Unless I
wash you, you have no part with me."
9"Then, Lord," Simon Peter replied, "not
just my feet but my hands and my head
as well!"
10Jesus answered, "A person who has
had a bath needs only to wash his feet;
his whole body is clean. And you are
clean, though not every one of you."
11For he knew who was going to betray
him, and that was why he said not every
one was clean.
12When he had finished washing their
feet, he put on his clothes and returned
to his place. "Do you understand what I
have done for you?" he asked them.
13"You call me 'Teacher' and 'Lord,' and
rightly so, for that is what I am.
14Now that I, your Lord and Teacher,
have washed your feet, you also should
wash one another's feet.
15I have set you an example that you
should do as I have done for you.
16I tell you the truth, no servant is
greater than his master, nor is a
messenger greater than the one who
sent him.
17Now that you know these things, you
will be blessed if you do them.
18"I am not referring to all of you; I know
those I have chosen. But this is to fulfill
the scripture: 'He who shares my bread
has lifted up his heel against me.'
19"I am telling you now before it happens,
so that when it does happen you will
believe that I am He.
20I tell you the truth, whoever accepts
anyone I send accepts me; and whoever
accepts me accepts the one who sent
me."
21After he had said this, Jesus was
troubled in spirit and testified, "I tell you
the truth, one of you is going to betray
me."
22His disciples stared at one another, at
a loss to know which of them he meant.
23One of them, the disciple whom Jesus
loved, was reclining next to him.
24Simon Peter motioned to this disciple
and said, "Ask him which one he
means."
25Leaning back against Jesus, he asked
him, "Lord, who is it?"
26Jesus answered, "It is the one to
whom I will give this piece of bread
when I have dipped it in the dish." Then,
dipping the piece of bread, he gave it to
Judas Iscariot, son of Simon.
27As soon as Judas took the bread,
Satan entered into him.
28"What you are about to do, do quickly,"
Jesus told him, but no one at the meal
understood why Jesus said this to him.
29Since Judas had charge of the money,
some thought Jesus was telling him to
buy what was needed for the Feast, or
to give something to the poor.
30As soon as Judas had taken the bread,
he went out. And it was night.
31When he was gone, Jesus said, "Now
is the Son of Man glorified and God is
glorified in him.
32If God is glorified in him, God will
glorify the Son in himself, and will glorify
him at once.
33"My children, I will be with you only a
little longer. You will look for me, and
just as I told the Jews, so I tell you now:
Where I am going, you cannot come.
34"A new command I give you: Love one
another. As I have loved you, so you
must love one another.
35By this all men will know that you are
my disciples, if you love one another."
36Simon Peter asked him, "Lord, where
are you going?" Jesus replied, "Where I
am going, you cannot follow now, but
you will follow later."
37Peter asked, "Lord, why can't I follow
you now? I will lay down my life for you."
38Then Jesus answered, "Will you really
lay down your life for me? I tell you the
truth, before the rooster crows, you will
disown me three times!

1"Do not let your hearts be troubled.
Trust in God ; trust also in me.
2In my Father's house are many rooms;
if it were not so, I would have told you. I
am going there to prepare a place for
you.
3And if I go and prepare a place for you,
I will come back and take you to be with
me that you also may be where I am.
4You know the way to the place where I
am going."
5Thomas said to him, "Lord, we don't
know where you are going, so how can
we know the way?"
6Jesus answered, "I am the way and the
truth and the life. No one comes to the
Father except through me.
7If you really knew me, you would know
my Father as well. From now on, you do
know him and have seen him."
8Philip said, "Lord, show us the Father
and that will be enough for us."
9Jesus answered: "Don't you know me,
Philip, even after I have been among
you such a long time? Anyone who has
seen me has seen the Father. How can
you say, 'Show us the Father'?
10Don't you believe that I am in the
Father, and that the Father is in me?
The words I say to you are not just my
own. Rather, it is the Father, living in me,
who is doing his work.
11Believe me when I say that I am in the
Father and the Father is in me; or at
least believe on the evidence of the
miracles themselves.
12I tell you the truth, anyone who has
faith in me will do what I have been
doing. He will do even greater things
than these, because I am going to the
Father.
13And I will do whatever you ask in my
name, so that the Son may bring glory
to the Father.
14You may ask me for anything in my
name, and I will do it.
15"If you love me, you will obey what I
command.
16And I will ask the Father, and he will
give you another Counselor to be with
you forever--
17the Spirit of truth. The world cannot
accept him, because it neither sees him
nor knows him. But you know him, for
he lives with you and will be in you.
18I will not leave you as orphans; I will
come to you.
19Before long, the world will not see me
anymore, but you will see me. Because I
live, you also will live.
20On that day you will realize that I am in
my Father, and you are in me, and I am
in you.
21Whoever has my commands and
obeys them, he is the one who loves me.
He who loves me will be loved by my
Father, and I too will love him and show
myself to him."
22Then Judas (not Judas Iscariot) said,
"But, Lord, why do you intend to show
yourself to us and not to the world?"
23Jesus replied, "If anyone loves me, he
will obey my teaching. My Father will
love him, and we will come to him and
make our home with him.
24He who does not love me will not obey
my teaching. These words you hear are
not my own; they belong to the Father
who sent me.
25"All this I have spoken while still with
you.
26But the Counselor, the Holy Spirit,
whom the Father will send in my name,
will teach you all things and will remind
you of everything I have said to you.
27Peace I leave with you; my peace I
give you. I do not give to you as the
world gives. Do not let your hearts be
troubled and do not be afraid.
28"You heard me say, 'I am going away
and I am coming back to you.' If you
loved me, you would be glad that I am
going to the Father, for the Father is
greater than I.
29I have told you now before it happens,
so that when it does happen you will
believe.
30I will not speak with you much longer,
for the prince of this world is coming. He
has no hold on me,
31but the world must learn that I love the
Father and that I do exactly what my
Father has commanded me. "Come
now; let us leave.

1"I am the true vine, and my Father
is the gardener.
2He cuts off every branch in me that
bears no fruit, while every branch that
does bear fruit he prunes so that it will
be even more fruitful.
3You are already clean because of the
word I have spoken to you.
4Remain in me, and I will remain in you.
No branch can bear fruit by itself; it must
remain in the vine. Neither can you bear
fruit unless you remain in me.
5"I am the vine; you are the branches. If
a man remains in me and I in him, he
will bear much fruit; apart from me you
can do nothing.
6If anyone does not remain in me, he is
like a branch that is thrown away and
withers; such branches are picked up,
thrown into the fire and burned.
7If you remain in me and my words
remain in you, ask whatever you wish,
and it will be given you.
8This is to my Father's glory, that you
bear much fruit, showing yourselves to
be my disciples.
9"As the Father has loved me, so have I
loved you. Now remain in my love.
10If you obey my commands, you will
remain in my love, just as I have obeyed
my Father's commands and remain in
his love.
11I have told you this so that my joy may
be in you and that your joy may be
complete.
12My command is this: Love each other
as I have loved you.
13Greater love has no one than this, that
he lay down his life for his friends.
14You are my friends if you do what I
command.
15I no longer call you servants, because
a servant does not know his master's
business. Instead, I have called you
friends, for everything that I learned
from my Father I have made known to
you.
16You did not choose me, but I chose
you and appointed you to go and bear
fruit--fruit that will last. Then the Father
will give you whatever you ask in my
name.
17This is my command: Love each other.
18"If the world hates you, keep in mind
that it hated me first.
19If you belonged to the world, it would
love you as its own. As it is, you do not
belong to the world, but I have chosen
you out of the world. That is why the
world hates you.
20Remember the words I spoke to you:
'No servant is greater than his master.' If
they persecuted me, they will persecute
you also. If they obeyed my teaching,
they will obey yours also.
21They will treat you this way because of
my name, for they do not know the One
who sent me.
22If I had not come and spoken to them,
they would not be guilty of sin. Now,
however, they have no excuse for their
sin.
23He who hates me hates my Father as
well.
24If I had not done among them what no
one else did, they would not be guilty of
sin. But now they have seen these
miracles, and yet they have hated both
me and my Father.
25But this is to fulfill what is written in
their Law: 'They hated me without
reason.'
26"When the Counselor comes, whom I
will send to you from the Father, the
Spirit of truth who goes out from the
Father, he will testify about me.
27And you also must testify, for you have
been with me from the beginning.

1"All this I have told you so that you
will not go astray.
2They will put you out of the synagogue;
in fact, a time is coming when anyone
who kills you will think he is offering a
service to God.
3They will do such things because they
have not known the Father or me.
4I have told you this, so that when the
time comes you will remember that I
warned you. I did not tell you this at first
because I was with you.
5"Now I am going to him who sent me,
yet none of you asks me, 'Where are
you going?'
6Because I have said these things, you
are filled with grief.
7But I tell you the truth: It is for your
good that I am going away. Unless I go
away, the Counselor will not come to
you; but if I go, I will send him to you.
8When he comes, he will convict the
world of guilt in regard to sin and
righteousness and judgment:
9in regard to sin, because men do not
believe in me;
10in regard to righteousness, because I
am going to the Father, where you can
see me no longer;
11and in regard to judgment, because
the prince of this world now stands
condemned.
12"I have much more to say to you, more
than you can now bear.
13But when he, the Spirit of truth, comes,
he will guide you into all truth. He will
not speak on his own; he will speak only
what he hears, and he will tell you what
is yet to come.
14He will bring glory to me by taking from
what is mine and making it known to you.
15All that belongs to the Father is mine.
That is why I said the Spirit will take
from what is mine and make it known to
you.
16"In a little while you will see me no
more, and then after a little while you
will see me."
17Some of his disciples said to one
another, "What does he mean by saying,
'In a little while you will see me no more,
and then after a little while you will see
me,' and 'Because I am going to the
Father'?"
18They kept asking, "What does he
mean by 'a little while'? We don't
understand what he is saying."
19Jesus saw that they wanted to ask him
about this, so he said to them, "Are you
asking one another what I meant when I
said, 'In a little while you will see me no
more, and then after a little while you
will see me'?
20I tell you the truth, you will weep and
mourn while the world rejoices. You will
grieve, but your grief will turn to joy.
21A woman giving birth to a child has
pain because her time has come; but
when her baby is born she forgets the
anguish because of her joy that a child
is born into the world.
22So with you: Now is your time of grief,
but I will see you again and you will
rejoice, and no one will take away your
joy.
23In that day you will no longer ask me
anything. I tell you the truth, my Father
will give you whatever you ask in my
name.
24Until now you have not asked for
anything in my name. Ask and you will
receive, and your joy will be complete.
25"Though I have been speaking
figuratively, a time is coming when I will
no longer use this kind of language but
will tell you plainly about my Father.
26In that day you will ask in my name. I
am not saying that I will ask the Father
on your behalf.
27No, the Father himself loves you
because you have loved me and have
believed that I came from God.
28I came from the Father and entered
the world; now I am leaving the world
and going back to the Father."
29Then Jesus' disciples said, "Now you
are speaking clearly and without figures
of speech.
30Now we can see that you know all
things and that you do not even need to
have anyone ask you questions. This
makes us believe that you came from
God."
31"You believe at last!" Jesus answered.
32"But a time is coming, and has come,
when you will be scattered, each to his
own home. You will leave me all alone.
Yet I am not alone, for my Father is with
me.
33"I have told you these things, so that in
me you may have peace. In this world
you will have trouble. But take heart! I
have overcome the world."

1After Jesus said this, he looked
toward heaven and prayed:
2"Father, the time has come. Glorify
your Son, that your Son may glorify you.
For you granted him authority over all
people that he might give eternal life to
all those you have given him.
3Now this is eternal life: that they may
know you, the only true God, and Jesus
Christ, whom you have sent.
4I have brought you glory on earth by
completing the work you gave me to do.
5And now, Father, glorify me in your
presence with the glory I had with you
before the world began.
6"I have revealed you to those whom
you gave me out of the world. They
were yours; you gave them to me and
they have obeyed your word.
7Now they know that everything you
have given me comes from you.
8For I gave them the words you gave me
and they accepted them. They knew
with certainty that I came from you, and
they believed that you sent me.
9I pray for them. I am not praying for the
world, but for those you have given me,
for they are yours.
10All I have is yours, and all you have is
mine. And glory has come to me
through them.
11I will remain in the world no longer, but
they are still in the world, and I am
coming to you. Holy Father, protect
them by the power of your name--the
name you gave me--so that they may be
one as we are one.
12While I was with them, I protected
them and kept them safe by that name
you gave me. None has been lost
except the one doomed to destruction
so that Scripture would be fulfilled.
13"I am coming to you now, but I say
these things while I am still in the world,
so that they may have the full measure
of my joy within them.
14I have given them your word and the
world has hated them, for they are not of
the world any more than I am of the
world.
15My prayer is not that you take them
out of the world but that you protect
them from the evil one.
16They are not of the world, even as I
am not of it.
17Sanctify them by the truth; your word
is truth.
18As you sent me into the world, I have
sent them into the world.
19For them I sanctify myself, that they
too may be truly sanctified.
20"My prayer is not for them alone. I pray
also for those who will believe in me
through their message,
21that all of them may be one, Father,
just as you are in me and I am in you.
May they also be in us so that the world
may believe that you have sent me.
22I have given them the glory that you
gave me, that they may be one as we
are one:
23I in them and you in me. May they be
brought to complete unity to let the
world know that you sent me and have
loved them even as you have loved me.
24"Father, I want those you have given
me to be with me where I am, and to
see my glory, the glory you have given
me because you loved me before the
creation of the world.
25"Righteous Father, though the world
does not know you, I know you, and
they know that you have sent me.
26I have made you known to them, and
will continue to make you known in
order that the love you have for me may
be in them and that I myself may be in
them."

1When he had finished praying,
Jesus left with his disciples and crossed
the Kidron Valley. On the other side
there was an olive grove, and he and his
disciples went into it.
2Now Judas, who betrayed him, knew
the place, because Jesus had often met
there with his disciples.
3So Judas came to the grove, guiding a
detachment of soldiers and some
officials from the chief priests and
Pharisees. They were carrying torches,
lanterns and weapons.
4Jesus, knowing all that was going to
happen to him, went out and asked
them, "Who is it you want?"
5"Jesus of Nazareth," they replied.
6"I am he," Jesus said. (And Judas the
traitor was standing there with them.)
When Jesus said, "I am he," they drew
back and fell to the ground.
7Again he asked them, "Who is it you
want?" And they said, "Jesus of
Nazareth."
8"I told you that I am he," Jesus
answered. "If you are looking for me,
then let these men go."
9This happened so that the words he
had spoken would be fulfilled: "I have
not lost one of those you gave me."
10Then Simon Peter, who had a sword,
drew it and struck the high priest's
servant, cutting off his right ear. (The
servant's name was Malchus.)
11Jesus commanded Peter, "Put your
sword away! Shall I not drink the cup the
Father has given me?"
12Then the detachment of soldiers with
its commander and the Jewish officials
arrested Jesus. They bound him
13and brought him first to Annas, who
was the father-in-law of Caiaphas, the
high priest that year.
14Caiaphas was the one who had
advised the Jews that it would be good if
one man died for the people.
15Simon Peter and another disciple were
following Jesus. Because this disciple
was known to the high priest, he went
with Jesus into the high priest's
courtyard,
16but Peter had to wait outside at the
door. The other disciple, who was
known to the high priest, came back,
spoke to the girl on duty there and
brought Peter in.
17"You are not one of his disciples, are
you?" the girl at the door asked Peter.
He replied, "I am not."
18It was cold, and the servants and
officials stood around a fire they had
made to keep warm. Peter also was
standing with them, warming himself.
19Meanwhile, the high priest questioned
Jesus about his disciples and his
teaching.
20"I have spoken openly to the world,"
Jesus replied. "I always taught in
synagogues or at the temple, where all
the Jews come together. I said nothing
in secret.
21Why question me? Ask those who
heard me. Surely they know what I
said."
22When Jesus said this, one of the
officials nearby struck him in the face.
"Is this the way you answer the high
priest?" he demanded.
23"If I said something wrong," Jesus
replied, "testify as to what is wrong. But
if I spoke the truth, why did you strike
me?"
24Then Annas sent him, still bound, to
Caiaphas the high priest.
25As Simon Peter stood warming himself,
he was asked, "You are not one of his
disciples, are you?" He denied it, saying,
"I am not."
26One of the high priest's servants, a
relative of the man whose ear Peter had
cut off, challenged him, "Didn't I see you
with him in the olive grove?"
27Again Peter denied it, and at that
moment a rooster began to crow.
28Then the Jews led Jesus from
Caiaphas to the palace of the Roman
governor. By now it was early morning,
and to avoid ceremonial uncleanness
the Jews did not enter the palace; they
wanted to be able to eat the Passover.
29So Pilate came out to them and asked,
"What charges are you bringing against
this man?"
30"If he were not a criminal," they replied,
"we would not have handed him over to
you."
31Pilate said, "Take him yourselves and
judge him by your own law."
32"But we have no right to execute
anyone," the Jews objected. This
happened so that the words Jesus had
spoken indicating the kind of death he
was going to die would be fulfilled.
33Pilate then went back inside the
palace, summoned Jesus and asked
him, "Are you the king of the Jews?"
34"Is that your own idea," Jesus asked,
"or did others talk to you about me?"
35"Am I a Jew?" Pilate replied. "It was
your people and your chief priests who
handed you over to me. What is it you
have done?"
36Jesus said, "My kingdom is not of this
world. If it were, my servants would fight
to prevent my arrest by the Jews. But
now my kingdom is from another place."
37"You are a king, then!" said Pilate.
Jesus answered, "You are right in
saying I am a king. In fact, for this
reason I was born, and for this I came
into the world, to testify to the truth.
Everyone on the side of truth listens to
me."
38"What is truth?" Pilate asked. With this
he went out again to the Jews and said,
"I find no basis for a charge against him.
39But it is your custom for me to release
to you one prisoner at the time of the
Passover. Do you want me to release
'the king of the Jews'?"
40They shouted back, "No, not him! Give
us Barabbas!" Now Barabbas had taken
part in a rebellion.
}

---jn19.1-19.42{ (ch19)
1Then Pilate took Jesus and had
him flogged.
2The soldiers twisted together a crown
of thorns and put it on his head. They
clothed him in a purple robe
3and went up to him again and again,
saying, "Hail, king of the Jews!" And
they struck him in the face.
4Once more Pilate came out and said to
the Jews, "Look, I am bringing him out
to you to let you know that I find no
basis for a charge against him."
5When Jesus came out wearing the
crown of thorns and the purple robe,
Pilate said to them, "Here is the man!"
6As soon as the chief priests and their
officials saw him, they shouted, "Crucify!
Crucify!" But Pilate answered, "You take
him and crucify him. As for me, I find no
basis for a charge against him."
7The Jews insisted, "We have a law,
and according to that law he must die,
because he claimed to be the Son of
God."
8When Pilate heard this, he was even
more afraid,
9and he went back inside the palace.
"Where do you come from?" he asked
Jesus, but Jesus gave him no answer.
10"Do you refuse to speak to me?" Pilate
said. "Don't you realize I have power
either to free you or to crucify you?"
11Jesus answered, "You would have no
power over me if it were not given to you
from above. Therefore the one who
handed me over to you is guilty of a
greater sin."
12From then on, Pilate tried to set Jesus
free, but the Jews kept shouting, "If you
let this man go, you are no friend of
Caesar. Anyone who claims to be a king
opposes Caesar."
13When Pilate heard this, he brought
Jesus out and sat down on the judge's
seat at a place known as the Stone
Pavement (which in Aramaic is
Gabbatha).
14It was the day of Preparation of
Passover Week, about the sixth hour.
"Here is your king," Pilate said to the
Jews.
15But they shouted, "Take him away!
Take him away! Crucify him!" "Shall I
crucify your king?" Pilate asked. "We
have no king but Caesar," the chief
priests answered.
16Finally Pilate handed him over to them
to be crucified.
17So the soldiers took charge of Jesus.
Carrying his own cross, he went out to
the place of the Skull (which in Aramaic
is called Golgotha).
18Here they crucified him, and with him
two others--one on each side and Jesus
in the middle.
19Pilate had a notice prepared and
fastened to the cross. It read:
20Many of the Jews read this sign, for
the place where Jesus was crucified
was near the city, and the sign was
written in Aramaic, Latin and Greek.
21The chief priests of the Jews protested
to Pilate, "Do not write 'The King of the
Jews,' but that this man claimed to be
king of the Jews."
22Pilate answered, "What I have written,
I have written."
23When the soldiers crucified Jesus,
they took his clothes, dividing them into
four shares, one for each of them, with
the undergarment remaining. This
garment was seamless, woven in one
piece from top to bottom.
24"Let's not tear it," they said to one
another. "Let's decide by lot who will get
it." This happened that the scripture
might be fulfilled which said, "They
divided my garments among them and
cast lots for my clothing." So this is what
the soldiers did.
25Near the cross of Jesus stood his
mother, his mother's sister, Mary the
wife of Clopas, and Mary Magdalene.
26When Jesus saw his mother there,
and the disciple whom he loved
standing nearby, he said to his mother,
"Dear woman, here is your son,"
27and to the disciple, "Here is your
mother." From that time on, this disciple
took her into his home.
28Later, knowing that all was now
completed, and so that the Scripture
would be fulfilled, Jesus said, "I am
thirsty."
29A jar of wine vinegar was there, so
they soaked a sponge in it, put the
sponge on a stalk of the hyssop plant,
and lifted it to Jesus' lips.
30When he had received the drink,
Jesus said, "It is finished." With that, he
bowed his head and gave up his spirit.
31Now it was the day of Preparation, and
the next day was to be a special
Sabbath. Because the Jews did not
want the bodies left on the crosses
during the Sabbath, they asked Pilate to
have the legs broken and the bodies
taken down.
32The soldiers therefore came and broke
the legs of the first man who had been
crucified with Jesus, and then those of
the other.
33But when they came to Jesus and
found that he was already dead, they
did not break his legs.
34Instead, one of the soldiers pierced
Jesus' side with a spear, bringing a
sudden flow of blood and water.
35The man who saw it has given
testimony, and his testimony is true. He
knows that he tells the truth, and he
testifies so that you also may believe.
36These things happened so that the
scripture would be fulfilled: "Not one of
his bones will be broken,"
37and, as another scripture says, "They
will look on the one they have pierced."
38Later, Joseph of Arimathea asked
Pilate for the body of Jesus. Now
Joseph was a disciple of Jesus, but
secretly because he feared the Jews.
With Pilate's permission, he came and
took the body away.
39He was accompanied by Nicodemus,
the man who earlier had visited Jesus at
night. Nicodemus brought a mixture of
myrrh and aloes, about seventy-five
pounds.
40Taking Jesus' body, the two of them
wrapped it, with the spices, in strips of
linen. This was in accordance with
Jewish burial customs.
41At the place where Jesus was crucified,
there was a garden, and in the garden a
new tomb, in which no one had ever
been laid.
42Because it was the Jewish day of
Preparation and since the tomb was
nearby, they laid Jesus there.
}

---jn20.1-20.31{ (ch20)
1Early on the first day of the week,
while it was still dark, Mary Magdalene
went to the tomb and saw that the stone
had been removed from the entrance.
2So she came running to Simon Peter
and the other disciple, the one Jesus
loved, and said, "They have taken the
Lord out of the tomb, and we don't know
where they have put him!"
3So Peter and the other disciple started
for the tomb.
4Both were running, but the other
disciple outran Peter and reached the
tomb first.
5He bent over and looked in at the strips
of linen lying there but did not go in.
6Then Simon Peter, who was behind
him, arrived and went into the tomb. He
saw the strips of linen lying there,
7as well as the burial cloth that had been
around Jesus' head. The cloth was
folded up by itself, separate from the
linen.
8Finally the other disciple, who had
reached the tomb first, also went inside.
He saw and believed.
9(They still did not understand from
Scripture that Jesus had to rise from the
dead.)
10Then the disciples went back to their
homes,
11but Mary stood outside the tomb crying.
As she wept, she bent over to look into
the tomb
12and saw two angels in white, seated
where Jesus' body had been, one at the
head and the other at the foot.
13They asked her, "Woman, why are you
crying?"
14"They have taken my Lord away," she
said, "and I don't know where they have
put him." At this, she turned around and
saw Jesus standing there, but she did
not realize that it was Jesus.
15"Woman," he said, "why are you
crying? Who is it you are looking for?"
Thinking he was the gardener, she said,
"Sir, if you have carried him away, tell
me where you have put him, and I will
get him."
16Jesus said to her, "Mary." She turned
toward him and cried out in Aramaic,
"Rabboni!" (which means Teacher).
17Jesus said, "Do not hold on to me, for I
have not yet returned to the Father. Go
instead to my brothers and tell them, 'I
am returning to my Father and your
Father, to my God and your God.' "
18Mary Magdalene went to the disciples
with the news: "I have seen the Lord!"
And she told them that he had said
these things to her.
19On the evening of that first day of the
week, when the disciples were together,
with the doors locked for fear of the
Jews, Jesus came and stood among
them and said, "Peace be with you!"
20After he said this, he showed them his
hands and side. The disciples were
overjoyed when they saw the Lord.
21Again Jesus said, "Peace be with you!
As the Father has sent me, I am
sending you."
22And with that he breathed on them and
said, "Receive the Holy Spirit.
23If you forgive anyone his sins, they are
forgiven; if you do not forgive them, they
are not forgiven."
24Now Thomas (called Didymus), one of
the Twelve, was not with the disciples
when Jesus came.
25So the other disciples told him, "We
have seen the Lord!" But he said to
them, "Unless I see the nail marks in his
hands and put my finger where the nails
were, and put my hand into his side, I
will not believe it."
26A week later his disciples were in the
house again, and Thomas was with
them. Though the doors were locked,
Jesus came and stood among them and
said, "Peace be with you!"
27Then he said to Thomas, "Put your
finger here; see my hands. Reach out
your hand and put it into my side. Stop
doubting and believe."
28Thomas said to him, "My Lord and my
God!"
29Then Jesus told him, "Because you
have seen me, you have believed;
blessed are those who have not seen
and yet have believed."
30Jesus did many other miraculous signs
in the presence of his disciples, which
are not recorded in this book.
31But these are written that you may
believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son
of God, and that by believing you may
have life in his name.
}

---jn21.1-21.25{ (ch21)
1Afterward Jesus appeared again
to his disciples, by the Sea of Tiberias. It
happened this way:
2Simon Peter, Thomas (called Didymus),
Nathanael from Cana in Galilee, the
sons of Zebedee, and two other
disciples were together.
3"I'm going out to fish," Simon Peter told
them, and they said, "We'll go with you."
So they went out and got into the boat,
but that night they caught nothing.
4Early in the morning, Jesus stood on
the shore, but the disciples did not
realize that it was Jesus.
5He called out to them, "Friends, haven't
you any fish?" "No," they answered.
6He said, "Throw your net on the right
side of the boat and you will find some."
When they did, they were unable to haul
the net in because of the large number
of fish.
7Then the disciple whom Jesus loved
said to Peter, "It is the Lord!" As soon as
Simon Peter heard him say, "It is the
Lord," he wrapped his outer garment
around him (for he had taken it off) and
jumped into the water.
8The other disciples followed in the boat,
towing the net full of fish, for they were
not far from shore, about a hundred
yards.
9When they landed, they saw a fire of
burning coals there with fish on it, and
some bread.
10Jesus said to them, "Bring some of the
fish you have just caught."
11Simon Peter climbed aboard and
dragged the net ashore. It was full of
large fish, 153, but even with so many
the net was not torn.
12Jesus said to them, "Come and have
breakfast." None of the disciples dared
ask him, "Who are you?" They knew it
was the Lord.
13Jesus came, took the bread and gave
it to them, and did the same with the fish.
14This was now the third time Jesus
appeared to his disciples after he was
raised from the dead.
15When they had finished eating, Jesus
said to Simon Peter, "Simon son of John,
do you truly love me more than these?"
"Yes, Lord," he said, "you know that I
love you." Jesus said, "Feed my lambs."
16Again Jesus said, "Simon son of John,
do you truly love me?" He answered,
"Yes, Lord, you know that I love you."
Jesus said, "Take care of my sheep."
17The third time he said to him, "Simon
son of John, do you love me?" Peter
was hurt because Jesus asked him the
third time, "Do you love me?" He said,
"Lord, you know all things; you know
that I love you."
18Jesus said, "Feed my sheep. I tell you
the truth, when you were younger you
dressed yourself and went where you
wanted; but when you are old you will
stretch out your hands, and someone
else will dress you and lead you where
you do not want to go."
19Jesus said this to indicate the kind of
death by which Peter would glorify God.
Then he said to him, "Follow me!"
20Peter turned and saw that the disciple
whom Jesus loved was following them.
(This was the one who had leaned back
against Jesus at the supper and had
said, "Lord, who is going to betray
you?")
21When Peter saw him, he asked, "Lord,
what about him?"
22Jesus answered, "If I want him to
remain alive until I return, what is that to
you? You must follow me."
23Because of this, the rumor spread
among the brothers that this disciple
would not die. But Jesus did not say that
he would not die; he only said, "If I want
him to remain alive until I return, what is
that to you?"
24This is the disciple who testifies to
these things and who wrote them down.
We know that his testimony is true.
25Jesus did many other things as well. If
every one of them were written down, I
suppose that even the whole world
would not have room for the books that
would be written.

  rulers of Judah; for out of you will come a ruler who will be the shepherd

  baptizing, he said to them:
  "You brood of vipers! Who warned you to flee from the coming wrath?
8Produce fruit in keeping with repentance.

"throw yourself down. For it is written: "
'He will command his angels concerning
you, and they will lift you up in their
hands, so that you will not strike your
foot against a stone.' "
7Jesus answered him, "It is also written:
'Do not put the Lord your God to the
test.' "
8Again, the devil took him to a very high
mountain and showed him all the
kingdoms of the world and their
splendor.
9"All this I will give you," he said, "if you
will bow down and worship me."
10Jesus said to him, "Away from me,
Satan! For it is written: 'Worship the
Lord your God, and serve him only.' "
11Then the devil left him, and angels
came and attended him.

12When Jesus heard that John had been
put in prison, he returned to Galilee.

---mt4.13-4.17 { (jesus preaches in galilee)
13Leaving Nazareth, he went and lived in
Capernaum, which was by the lake in
the area of Zebulun and Naphtali--
14to fulfill what was said through the
prophet Isaiah:
15"Land of Zebulun and land of Naphtali,
the way to the sea, along the Jordan,
Galilee of the Gentiles--
16the people living in darkness have
seen a great light; on those living in the
land of the shadow of death a light has
dawned."
17From that time on Jesus began to
preach, "Repent, for the kingdom of
heaven is near."
}

---mt4.18-4.20 { (jesus calls simon and andrew)
18As Jesus was walking beside the Sea
of Galilee, he saw two brothers, Simon
called Peter and his brother Andrew.
They were casting a net into the lake,
for they were fishermen.
19"Come, follow me," Jesus said, "and I
will make you fishers of men."
20At once they left their nets and
followed him.
}

---mt4.21-4.22 { (jesus calls james and john)
21Going on from there, he saw two other
brothers, James son of Zebedee and his
brother John. They were in a boat with
their father Zebedee, preparing their
nets. Jesus called them,
22and immediately they left the boat and
their father and followed him.
}

---mt4.23-4.25 { (jesus heals in galilee)
23Jesus went throughout Galilee,
teaching in their synagogues, preaching
the good news of the kingdom, and
healing every disease and sickness
among the people.
24News about him spread all over Syria,
and people brought to him all who were
ill with various diseases, those suffering
severe pain, the demon-possessed,
those having seizures, and the
paralyzed, and he healed them.
25Large crowds from Galilee, the
Decapolis, Jerusalem, Judea and the
region across the Jordan followed him.
}

---mt5.1-5.2 { (sermon on the mount)
1Now when he saw the crowds, he
went up on a mountainside and sat
down. His disciples came to him,
2and he began to teach them saying:
}

---mt5.3-5.12 { (beatitudes)
3"Blessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs
is the kingdom of heaven.
4Blessed are those who mourn, for they
will be comforted.
5Blessed are the meek, for they will
inherit the earth.
6Blessed are those who hunger and
thirst for righteousness, for they will be
filled.
7Blessed are the merciful, for they will
be shown mercy.
8Blessed are the pure in heart, for they
will see God.
9Blessed are the peacemakers, for they
will be called sons of God.
10Blessed are those who are persecuted
because of righteousness, for theirs is
the kingdom of heaven.
11"Blessed are you when people insult
you, persecute you and falsely say all
kinds of evil against you because of me.
12Rejoice and be glad, because great is
your reward in heaven, for in the same
way they persecuted the prophets who
were before you.
}

---mt5.13-5.16 { (salt and light)
13"You are the salt of the earth. But if the
salt loses its saltiness, how can it be
made salty again? It is no longer good
for anything, except to be thrown out
and trampled by men.
14"You are the light of the world. A city
on a hill cannot be hidden.
15Neither do people light a lamp and put
it under a bowl. Instead they put it on its
stand, and it gives light to everyone in
the house.
16In the same way, let your light shine
before men, that they may see your
good deeds and praise your Father in
heaven.
}

---mt5.13-17.20 { (not abolish but fulfil)
17"Do not think that I have come to
abolish the Law or the Prophets; I have
not come to abolish them but to fulfill
them.
18I tell you the truth, until heaven and
earth disappear, not the smallest letter,
not the least stroke of a pen, will by any
means disappear from the Law until
everything is accomplished.
19Anyone who breaks one of the least of
these commandments and teaches
others to do the same will be called
least in the kingdom of heaven, but
whoever practices and teaches these
commands will be called great in the
kingdom of heaven.
20For I tell you that unless your
righteousness surpasses that of the
Pharisees and the teachers of the law,
you will certainly not enter the kingdom
of heaven.
}

---mt5.21-17.48 { (you have heard)
21"You have heard that it was said to the
people long ago, 'Do not murder, and
anyone who murders will be subject to
judgment.'
22But I tell you that anyone who is angry
with his brother will be subject to
judgment. Again, anyone who says to
his brother, 'Raca, ' is answerable to the
Sanhedrin. But anyone who says, 'You
fool!' will be in danger of the fire of hell.
23"Therefore, if you are offering your gift
at the altar and there remember that
your brother has something against you,
24leave your gift there in front of the altar.
First go and be reconciled to your
brother; then come and offer your gift.
25"Settle matters quickly with your
adversary who is taking you to court. Do
it while you are still with him on the way,
or he may hand you over to the judge,
and the judge may hand you over to the
officer, and you may be thrown into
prison.
26I tell you the truth, you will not get out
until you have paid the last penny.
27"You have heard that it was said, 'Do
not commit adultery.'
28But I tell you that anyone who looks at
a woman lustfully has already
committed adultery with her in his heart.
29If your right eye causes you to sin,
gouge it out and throw it away. It is
better for you to lose one part of your
body than for your whole body to be
thrown into hell.
30And if your right hand causes you to
sin, cut it off and throw it away. It is
better for you to lose one part of your
body than for your whole body to go into
hell.
31"It has been said, 'Anyone who
divorces his wife must give her a
certificate of divorce.'
32But I tell you that anyone who divorces
his wife, except for marital
unfaithfulness, causes her to become an
adulteress, and anyone who marries the
divorced woman commits adultery.
33"Again, you have heard that it was said
to the people long ago, 'Do not break
your oath, but keep the oaths you have
made to the Lord.'
34But I tell you, Do not swear at all:
either by heaven, for it is God's throne;
35or by the earth, for it is his footstool; or
by Jerusalem, for it is the city of the
Great King.
36And do not swear by your head, for
you cannot make even one hair white or
black.
37Simply let your 'Yes' be 'Yes,' and your
'No,' 'No'; anything beyond this comes
from the evil one.
38"You have heard that it was said, 'Eye
for eye, and tooth for tooth.'
39But I tell you, Do not resist an evil
person. If someone strikes you on the
right cheek, turn to him the other also.
40And if someone wants to sue you and
take your tunic, let him have your cloak
as well.
41If someone forces you to go one mile,
go with him two miles.
42Give to the one who asks you, and do
not turn away from the one who wants
to borrow from you.
43"You have heard that it was said, 'Love
your neighbor and hate your enemy.'
44But I tell you: Love your enemies and
pray for those who persecute you,
45that you may be sons of your Father in
heaven. He causes his sun to rise on
the evil and the good, and sends rain on
the righteous and the unrighteous.
46If you love those who love you, what
reward will you get? Are not even the
tax collectors doing that?
47And if you greet only your brothers,
what are you doing more than others?
Do not even pagans do that?
48Be perfect, therefore, as your heavenly
Father is perfect.
}

---mt6.1-6.34 { (ch6)
1"Be careful not to do your 'acts of
righteousness' before men, to be seen
by them. If you do, you will have no
reward from your Father in heaven.
2"So when you give to the needy, do not
announce it with trumpets, as the
hypocrites do in the synagogues and on
the streets, to be honored by men. I tell
you the truth, they have received their
reward in full.
3But when you give to the needy, do not
let your left hand know what your right
hand is doing,
4so that your giving may be in secret.
Then your Father, who sees what is
done in secret, will reward you.
5"And when you pray, do not be like the
hypocrites, for they love to pray standing
in the synagogues and on the street
corners to be seen by men. I tell you the
truth, they have received their reward in
full.
6But when you pray, go into your room,
close the door and pray to your Father,
who is unseen. Then your Father, who
sees what is done in secret, will reward
you.
7And when you pray, do not keep on
babbling like pagans, for they think they
will be heard because of their many
words.
8Do not be like them, for your Father
knows what you need before you ask
him.
9"This, then, is how you should pray: "
'Our Father in heaven, hallowed be your
name,
10your kingdom come, your will be done
on earth as it is in heaven.
11Give us today our daily bread.
12Forgive us our debts, as we also have
forgiven our debtors.
13And lead us not into temptation, but
deliver us from the evil one. '
14For if you forgive men when they sin
against you, your heavenly Father will
also forgive you.
15But if you do not forgive men their sins,
your Father will not forgive your sins.
16"When you fast, do not look somber as
the hypocrites do, for they disfigure their
faces to show men they are fasting. I tell
you the truth, they have received their
reward in full.
17But when you fast, put oil on your
head and wash your face,
18so that it will not be obvious to men
that you are fasting, but only to your
Father, who is unseen; and your Father,
who sees what is done in secret, will
reward you.
19"Do not store up for yourselves
treasures on earth, where moth and rust
destroy, and where thieves break in and
steal.
20But store up for yourselves treasures
in heaven, where moth and rust do not
destroy, and where thieves do not break
in and steal.
21For where your treasure is, there your
heart will be also.
22"The eye is the lamp of the body. If
your eyes are good, your whole body
will be full of light.
23But if your eyes are bad, your whole
body will be full of darkness. If then the
light within you is darkness, how great is
that darkness!
24"No one can serve two masters. Either
he will hate the one and love the other,
or he will be devoted to the one and
despise the other. You cannot serve
both God and Money.
25"Therefore I tell you, do not worry
about your life, what you will eat or
drink; or about your body, what you will
wear. Is not life more important than
food, and the body more important than
clothes?
26Look at the birds of the air; they do not
sow or reap or store away in barns, and
yet your heavenly Father feeds them.
Are you not much more valuable than
they?
27Who of you by worrying can add a
single hour to his life ?
28"And why do you worry about clothes?
See how the lilies of the field grow. They
do not labor or spin.
29Yet I tell you that not even Solomon in
all his splendor was dressed like one of
these.
30If that is how God clothes the grass of
the field, which is here today and
tomorrow is thrown into the fire, will he
not much more clothe you, O you of little
faith?
31So do not worry, saying, 'What shall
we eat?' or 'What shall we drink?' or
'What shall we wear?'
32For the pagans run after all these
things, and your heavenly Father knows
that you need them.
33But seek first his kingdom and his
righteousness, and all these things will
be given to you as well.
34Therefore do not worry about
tomorrow, for tomorrow will worry about
itself. Each day has enough trouble of
its own.

1"Do not judge, or you too will be
judged.
2For in the same way you judge others,
you will be judged, and with the
measure you use, it will be measured to
you.
3"Why do you look at the speck of
sawdust in your brother's eye and pay
no attention to the plank in your own
eye?
4How can you say to your brother, 'Let
me take the speck out of your eye,'
when all the time there is a plank in your
own eye?
5You hypocrite, first take the plank out of
your own eye, and then you will see
clearly to remove the speck from your
brother's eye.

"Be clean!" Immediately he was cured of
his leprosy.

him."
8The centurion replied, "Lord, I do not
deserve to have you come under my
roof. But just say the word, and my
servant will be healed.
9For I myself am a man under authority,
with soldiers under me. I tell this one,
'Go,' and he goes; and that one, 'Come,'
and he comes. I say to my servant, 'Do
this,' and he does it."
10When Jesus heard this, he was
astonished and said to those following
him, "I tell you the truth, I have not found
anyone in Israel with such great faith.
11I say to you that many will come from
the east and the west, and will take their
places at the feast with Abraham, Isaac
and Jacob in the kingdom of heaven.
12But the subjects of the kingdom will be
thrown outside, into the darkness, where
there will be weeping and gnashing of
teeth."

It will be done just as you believed it
would." And his servant was healed at
that very hour.

---mt8.18-8.34 { (jesus heals)
18When Jesus saw the crowd around
him, he gave orders to cross to the other
side of the lake.
19Then a teacher of the law came to him
and said, "Teacher, I will follow you
wherever you go."
20Jesus replied, "Foxes have holes and
birds of the air have nests, but the Son
of Man has no place to lay his head."
21Another disciple said to him, "Lord,
first let me go and bury my father."
22But Jesus told him, "Follow me, and let
the dead bury their own dead."
23Then he got into the boat and his
disciples followed him.
24Without warning, a furious storm came
up on the lake, so that the waves swept
over the boat. But Jesus was sleeping.
25The disciples went and woke him,
saying, "Lord, save us! We're going to
drown!"
26He replied, "You of little faith, why are
you so afraid?" Then he got up and
rebuked the winds and the waves, and it
was completely calm.
27The men were amazed and asked,
"What kind of man is this? Even the
winds and the waves obey him!"
28When he arrived at the other side in
the region of the Gadarenes, two
demon-possessed men coming from the
tombs met him. They were so violent
that no one could pass that way.
29"What do you want with us, Son of
God?" they shouted. "Have you come
here to torture us before the appointed
time?"
30Some distance from them a large herd
of pigs was feeding.
31The demons begged Jesus, "If you
drive us out, send us into the herd of
pigs."
32He said to them, "Go!" So they came
out and went into the pigs, and the
whole herd rushed down the steep bank
into the lake and died in the water.
33Those tending the pigs ran off, went
into the town and reported all this,
including what had happened to the
demon-possessed men.
34Then the whole town went out to meet
Jesus. And when they saw him, they
pleaded with him to leave their region.

2Some men brought to him a paralytic, lying on a mat.
  When Jesus saw their faith, he said to the paralytic,
  "Take heart, son; your sins are forgiven."
3At this, some of the teachers of the law said to themselves,
  "This fellow is blaspheming!"
4Knowing their thoughts, Jesus said,
  "Why do you entertain evil thoughts in your hearts?
5Which is easier: to say, 'Your sins are forgiven,'
  or to say, 'Get up and walk'?
6But so that you may know that the Son of Man has authority on earth
  to forgive sins...."
  Then he said to the paralytic, "Get up, take your mat and go home."

11When the Pharisees saw this, they asked his disciples, "Why does your
teacher eat with tax collectors and 'sinners'?"
12On hearing this, Jesus said, "It is not
the healthy who need a doctor, but the sick.
13But go and learn what this means: 'I desire mercy, not sacrifice.' For I have
not come to call the righteous, but sinners."

then they will fast.

18While he was saying this, a ruler came and knelt before him and said, "My
daughter has just died. But come and put your hand on her, and she will live."
19Jesus got up and went with him, and so did his disciples.
20Just then a woman who had been subject to bleeding for twelve years
came up behind him and touched the edge of his cloak.
21She said to herself, "If I only touch his cloak, I will be healed."
22Jesus turned and saw her. "Take heart, daughter," he said, "your faith has
healed you." And the woman was healed from that moment.
23When Jesus entered the ruler's house
and saw the flute players and the noisy crowd,
24he said, "Go away. The girl is not dead
but asleep." But they laughed at him.
25After the crowd had been put outside,
he went in and took the girl by the hand, and she got up.

28When he had gone indoors, the blind men came to him, and he asked them,
"Do you believe that I am able to do this?" "Yes, Lord," they replied.
29Then he touched their eyes and said,
"According to your faith will it be done to you";

warned them sternly, "See that no one knows about this."
